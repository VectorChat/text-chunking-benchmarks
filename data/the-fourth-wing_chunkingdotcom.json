  "Readers who may be sensitive to these elements, please take note, and prepare to enter Basgiath W ar College...To Aar on. My own Captain America. Through the deployments, the moves, the sunniest highs, and the darkest lows, it\u2019s always been you and me, kiddo. Here\u2019s to the artists. You hold the power to shape the world.

A rider without their dragon is dead. \u2014A RTICLE ONE, SECTION ONE THE DRAGON RIDER\u2019S CODEX CHAPTER ONE Conscription Day is always the deadliest. Maybe that\u2019s why the sunrise is especially beautiful this morning\u2014because I know it might be my last.",
  "I tighten the straps of my heavy canvas rucksack and trudge up the wide staircase of the stone fortress I call home. My chest heaves with exertion, my lungs burning by the time I reach the stone corridor leading to General Sorrengail\u2019 s office. This is what six months of intense physical training has given me\u2014the ability to barely climb six flights of stairs with a thirty- pound pack. I\u2019m so fucked. The thousands of twenty-year -olds waiting outside the gate to enter their chosen quadrant for service are the smartest and strongest in Navarre. Hundreds of them have been preparing for the Riders Quadrant, the chance to become one of the elite, since birth. I\u2019ve had exactly six months. The expressionl ess guards lining the wide hallway at the top of the landing avoid my eyes as I pass, but that\u2019s nothing new. Besides, being ignored is the best possible scenario for me.",
  "Basgiath War College isn\u2019t know n for being kind to\u2026well, anyone, even those of us whose mothers are in command. Every Navarrian officer, whether they choose to be schooled as healers, scribes, infantry , or riders, is molded within these cruel walls over threeyears, honed into weapons to secure our mountainous borders from the violent invasion attempts of the kingdom of Poromiel and their gryphon riders. The weak don\u2019t survive here, especially not in the Riders Quadrant. The dragons make sure of that. \u201cYou\u2019re sending her to die!\u201d a familiar voice thunders through the general\u2019 s thick wooden door, and I gasp. There\u2019 s only one woman on the Continent foolish enough to raise her voice to the general, but she\u2019s supposed to be on the border with the Eastern W ing.",
  "Mira. There\u2019 s a muffled response from the office, and I reach for the door handle. \u201cShe doesn\u2019 t stand a chance,\u201d Mira shouts as I force the heavy door open and the weight of my pack shifts forward, nearly taking me down. Shit. The general curses from behind her desk, and I grab onto the back of the crimson-upholstered couch to catch my balance. \u201cDamn it, Mom, she can\u2019t even handle her rucksack,\u201d Mira snaps, rushing to my side. \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d My cheeks heat with mortification, and I force myself upright. She\u2019s been back for five minutes and is already trying to save me. Because you need saving, you fool. I don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want any part of this Riders Quadrant shit. It\u2019s not like I have a death wish.",
  "I would have been better off failing the admission test to Basgiath and going straight to the army with the majority of conscripts. But I can handle my rucksack, and I will handle myself. \u201cOh, Violet.\u201d Worried brown eyes look down at me as strong hands brace my shoulders. \u201cHi, Mira.\u201d A smile tugs at the corners of my mouth. She migh t be here to say her goodbyes, but I\u2019m just glad to see my sister for the first time in years. Her eyes soften, and her fingers flex on my shoulders like she might pull me into a hug, but she steps back and turns to stand at my side, facing ourmother . \u201cYou can\u2019 t do this.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s already done.\u201d Mom shrugs, the lines of her fitted black uniform rising and falling with the motion. I scoff. So much for the hope of a reprieve. Not that I ever should have expected, or even hoped for, an ounce of mercy from a woman who\u2019 s been made famous for her lack of it. \u201cThen undo it,\u201d Mira seethes. \u201cShe\u2019 s spent her whole life training to become a scribe.",
  "She wasn \u2019 t raised to be a rider . \u201d \u201c Well , she certainly isn \u2019 t you , is she , Lieutenant Sorrengail ? \u201d Mom braces her hands on the immacu late surface of her desk and leans in slightly as she stands , looking us over with narrowed , appraising eyes that mirror the dragons \u2019 carved into the furniture \u2019 s massive legs .",
  "I don\u2019t need the prohibited power of mind reading to know exactly what she sees. At twenty-six years old, Mira\u2019 s a younger version of our mother . She\u2019s tall, with strong, powerful muscles toned from years of sparring and hundreds of hours spent on the back of her dragon. Her skin practically glows with health, and her golden-brown hair is sheared short for combat in the same style as Mom\u2019 s. But more than looks, she carries the same arrogance, the unwavering conv iction that she belongs in the sky. She\u2019s a rider through and through. She\u2019s everything I\u2019m not, and the disapproving shake of Mom\u2019 s head says she agrees. I\u2019m too short. Too frail. What curves I do have should be muscle, and my traitorous body makes me embarrassingly vulnerable.",
  "Mom walks toward us, her polished black boots gleaming in the mage lights that flicker from the sconces. She picks up the end of my long braid, scoffs at the section just above my shoulders where the brown strands start to lose their warmth of color and slowly fade to a steely , metallic silver by the ends, and then drops it. \u201cPale skin, pale eyes, pale hair.\u201d Her gaze siphons every ounce of my confidence down to the marrow in my bones. \u201cIt\u2019s like that fever stole all your coloring along with your stren gth.\u201d Griefflashes through her eyes and her brows furrow . \u201cI told him not to keep you in that library .\u201d It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard her curse the sickness that nearly killed her while she was pregnant with me or the library Dad made my second home once she\u2019d been stationed here at Basgiath as an instructor and he as a scribe. \u201cI love that library ,\u201d I counter . It\u2019s been more than a year since his heart finally failed, and the Archives are still the only place that feels like home in this giant fortress, the only place where I still feel my father \u2019s presence. \u201cSpoken like the daughter of a scribe,\u201d Mom says quietly , and I see it\u2014 the wom an she was while Dad was alive. Softer . Kinder\u2026at least for her family .",
  "\u201cI am the daughter of a scribe.\u201d My back screams at me, so I let my pack slip from my shoulders, guiding it to the floor , and take my first full breath since leaving my room. Mom blinks, and that softer woman is gone, leaving only the general. \u201cYou\u2019re the daughter of a rider, you are twenty years old, and today is Conscription Day. I let you finish your tutoring, but like I told you last spring, I will not watch one of my children enter the Scribe Quadrant, Violet.\u201d \u201cBecause scribes are so far bene ath riders?\u201d I grumble, knowing perfectly well that riders are the top of the social and military hierarchy .",
  "It helps that their bonded dragons roast people for fun. \u201cYes!\u201d Her customary composu re slips. \u201cAnd if you dare walk into the tunnel toward the Scribe Quadrant today , I will rip you out by that ridiculous braid and put you on the parapet myself.\u201d My stomach turns over . \u201cDad wouldn\u2019 t want this!\u201d Mira ar gues, color flushing up her neck. \u201cI loved your father, but he\u2019s dead,\u201d Mom says, as if giving the weather report. \u201cI doubt he wants much these days.\u201dI suck in a breath but keep my mouth shut. Arguing will get me nowhere. She\u2019s never listened to a damne d thing I\u2019ve had to say before, and today is no dif ferent. \u201cSending Violet into the Riders Quadrant is tantamount to a death sentence.\u201d Gues s Mira isn\u2019t done arguing. Mira\u2019 s never done arguing with Mom, and the frustrating thing about it is that Mom has always respected her for it. Double standard for the win. \u201cShe\u2019 s not strong enough, Mom! She\u2019s already broken her arm this year, she sprains some joint every other week, and she\u2019 s not tall enough to mount any dragon big enough to keep her alive in a battle.\u201d \u201cSeriously , Mira ?\u201d What. The. Hell.",
  "My fingernails bite into my palms as I curl my hands into fists. Knowing my chances of survival are minimal is one thing. Having my sister throw my inadequacies in my face is another . \u201cAre you calling me weak ?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Mira squeezes my hand. \u201cJust\u2026fragile.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s not any better .\u201d Dragons don\u2019t bond fragile women.",
  "They incinerate them. \u201cSo she\u2019s small.\u201d Mom scans me up and down, taking in the generous fit of the cream belted tunic and pants I selected this morning for my potential execution. I snort. \u201cAre we just listing my faults now?\u201d \u201cI never said it was a fault.\u201d Mom turns to my sister . \u201cMira, Violet deals with more pain before lunch than you do in an entire week. If any of my children is capable of surviving the Riders Quadrant, it\u2019 s her.\u201d My eyeb rows rise. That sounded an awful lot like a compliment, but with Mom, I\u2019m never quite sure. \u201cHow many rider candidates die on Conscription Day, Mom? Forty? Fifty? Are you that eager to bury another child?\u201d Mira seethes. I cringe as the temperature in the room plummets, courtesy of Mom\u2019 s storm-wielding signet power she channels through her dragon, Aimsir .My chest tightens at the memory of my brother . No one has dared to mention Brennan or his dragon in the five years since they died fighting the Tyrrish rebellion in the south. Mom tolerates me and respects Mira, but she loved Brennan.",
  "Dad did, too. His chest pains started right after Brennan\u2019 s death. Mom\u2019 s jaw tightens and her eyes threaten retribution as she glares at Mira. My sister swallows but holds her own in the staring competition. \u201cMom,\u201d I start. \u201cShe didn\u2019 t mean\u2014\u201d \u201cGet. Out. Lieut enant.\u201d Mom\u2019 s words are soft puffs of steam in the frigid office. \u201cBefore I report you absent from your unit without leave.\u201d Mira straightens her posture, nods once, and pivots with military precision, then strides for the door without another word, grabbing a small rucksack on the way out. It\u2019s the first time Mom and I have been alone in months. Her eyes meet mine, and the temperature rises as she takes a deep breath. \u201cYou scored in the top quarter for speed and agility during the entrance exam. You\u2019ll do just fine. All Sorrengails do just fine.\u201d She skim s the backs of her fingers down my cheek, barely grazing my skin. \u201cSo much like your father ,\u201d she whispers before clearing her throat and backing up a few steps.",
  "Guess there are no meritorious service awards for emotional availability . \u201cI won\u2019t be able to acknowledge you for the next three years,\u201d she says, sitting back on the edge of her desk. \u201cSince, as commanding general of Basgiath, I\u2019ll be your far superior of ficer.\u201d \u201cI know .\u201d It\u2019s the least of my concerns, considering she barely acknowledges me now . \u201cYou won\u2019 t get any special treatment just because you\u2019re my daughter , either . If anything, they\u2019ll come after you harder to make you prove yourself.\u201d She arches an eyebrow . \u201cWell aware.\u201d Good thing I\u2019ve been training with Major Gillstead for thelast several months since Mom made her decree. She sighs and forces a smile. \u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll see you in the valley at Threshing, candidate. Though you\u2019ll be a cadet by sunset, I suppose.\u201d Or dead . Neither of us says it.",
  "\u201cGood luck, Candidate Sorrengail.\u201d She moves back behind her desk, effectively dismissing me. \u201cThank you, General.\u201d I heft my pack onto my shoulders and walk out of her of fice. A guard closes the door behind me. \u201cShe\u2019 s batshit crazy ,\u201d Mira says from the center of the hallway , right between where two guards are positioned. \u201cThey\u2019ll tell her you said that.\u201d \u201cLike they don\u2019t already know ,\u201d she grinds out through clenched teeth. \u201cLet\u2019 s go. We only have an hour before all candidates have to report, and I saw thousands waiting outside the gates when I flew over.\u201d She starts walking, leading me down the stone staircase and through the hallways to my room. Well\u2026it was my room. In the thirty minutes I\u2019ve been gone, all my personal items have been packed into crates that now sit stacked in the corner . My stom ach sinks to the hardwood floor .",
  "She had my entire life boxed. \u201cShe\u2019 s fucking efficient, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Mira mutters before turning my way, her gaze passing over me in open assessment. \u201cI was hoping I\u2019d be able to talk her out of it. Y ou were never meant for the Riders Quadrant.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019ve mentioned.\u201d I lift an eyebrow at her . \u201cRepeatedly .\u201d \u201cSorry .\u201d She winces, dropping to the ground and emptying her pack. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cWhat Brennan did for me,\u201d she says softly , and grief lodges in my throat. \u201cCan you use a sword?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cToo heavy . I\u2019m pretty quick with daggers, though.\u201dReally damned quick. Lightning quick. What I lack in strength, I make up for in speed. \u201cI figured. Good. Now , drop your pack and take off those horrible boots.\u201d She sorts through the items she\u2019s brought, handing me new boots and a black uniform. \u201cPut these on.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019 s wrong with my pack?\u201d I ask but drop my rucksack anyway. She immediately opens it, ripping out everything I\u2019d carefully packed.",
  "\u201cMira! That took me all night!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re carrying way too much , and your boots are a death trap. You\u2019ll slip right off the parapet with those smooth soles. I had a set of rubber - bottomed rider boots made for you just in case, and this, my dear Violet, is the worst case.\u201d Books start flying, landing in the vicinity of the crate. \u201cHey , I can only take what I can carry , and I want those!\u201d I lunge for the next book before she has a chance to toss it, barely managing to save my favorite collection of dark fables. \u201cAre you willing to die for it?\u201d she asks, her eyes turning hard. \u201cI can carry it!\u201d This is all wron g. I\u2019m supposed to be dedicatin g my life to books, not throwing them in the corner to lighten my rucksack. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t. You\u2019re barely thrice the weight of the pack, the parapet is roughly eighteen inches wide, two hundred feet aboveground, and last time I looked , those were rain clouds moving in. They\u2019re not going to give you a rain delay just because the bridge might get a little slick, sis. You\u2019ll fall. You\u2019ll die. Now , are you going to listen to me?",
  "Or are you going to join the other dead candidates at tomorro w morning\u2019 s roll call?\u201d There\u2019 s no trace of my older sister in the rider before me. This woman is shrewd, cunning, and a touch cruel. This is the woman who survived all three years with only one scar, the one her own dragon gave her during Threshing. \u201cBecause that\u2019s all you\u2019ll be. Another tombstone. Another name scorched in stone. Ditch the books.\u201d \u201cDad gave this one to me,\u201d I murmur , pressing the book against my chest.Maybe it\u2019s childish, just a collec tion of stories that warn us against the lure of magic, and even demonize dragons, but it\u2019 s all I have left. She sighs. \u201cIs it that old book of folklore about dark-wielding vermin and their wyvern? Haven\u2019 t you read it a thousand times already?\u201d \u201cProbably more,\u201d I admit. \u201cAnd they\u2019re venin , not vermin.\u201d \u201cDad and his allegories,\u201d she says. \u201cJust don\u2019t try to chann el power without being a bonded rider and red-eyed monsters won\u2019 t hide under your bed, waiting to snatch you away on their two-legged dragons to join their dark army.\u201d She retrieves the last book I packed from the rucksack and hands it to me. \u201cDitch the books.",
  "Dad can\u2019t save you. He tried. I tried.",
  "Decide, V iolet. Are you going to die a scribe? Or live as a rider?\u201d I glance down at the books in my arms and make my choice. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass.\u201d I put the fables in the corner but keep the other tome in my hands as I face my sister . \u201cA pain in the ass who is going to keep you alive. What\u2019 s that one for?\u201d she challenges. \u201cKilling people.\u201d I hand it back to her . A slow smile spreads across her face. \u201cGood. You can keep that one. Now , get changed while I sort out the rest of this mess.\u201d The bell rings high above us. W e have forty-five minutes. I dress quickly , but everything feels like it belongs to someone else, though it\u2019s obviously tailored to my size. My tunic is replaced by a tight- fitting black shirt that covers my arms, and my breezy pants are exchanged for leather ones that hug every curve. Then she laces me into a vest-style corset over the shirt. \u201cKeeps it from rubbing,\u201d she explains. \u201cLike the gear riders wear into battle.\u201d Have to admit, the clothes are pretty badass, even if I feel like an imposter . Gods, this is r eally happening . \u201cExactly , because that\u2019 s what you\u2019re doing.",
  "Going into battle.\u201d The combination of leather and a fabric I don\u2019t recognize covers me fromcollarbone to just below my waist, wrapping over my breasts and crossing up and over my shoulders. I finger the hidden sheaths sewn diagonally along the rib cage. \u201cFor your daggers.\u201d \u201cI only have four .\u201d I grab them from the pile on the floor . \u201cYou\u2019ll earn more.\u201d I slide my weapons into the sheaths, as though my ribs themselves have become weapons.",
  "The design is ingenious. Between my ribs and the sheaths at my thighs, the blades are easily accessible. I barely recognize myself in the mirror . I look like a rider . I still feel like a scribe. Minutes later, half of what I packed is piled onto the crates. She\u2019s repacked my rucksack, discarding anything deemed unnecessary and almost everything senti mental while word-vomiting advice about how to survive in the quadrant. Then she surprise s me by doing the most sentimental thing ever\u2014telling me to sit between her knees so she can braid my hair into a crown. It\u2019s like I\u2019m a kid again instead of a full-grown woman, but I do it. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I test the materi al just above my heart, scratchi ng it with my fingernail. \u201cSomething I designed,\u201d she explains, tugging my braid painfully tight against my scalp. \u201cI had it specially made for you with Teine\u2019 s scales sewn in, so be careful with it.\u201d \u201cDragon scales? \u201d I jerk my head back to look at her. \u201cHow?",
  "Teine is huge.\u201d \u201cI happen to know a rider whose powers can make big things very small.\u201d A devious smile plays across her lips. \u201cAnd smaller things\u2026much, much bigger .\u201d I roll my eyes. Mira\u2019s always been more vocal about her men than I have been\u2026about all two of them. \u201cI mean, how much bigger?\u201dShe laughs, then tugs on my braid. \u201cHead forward. You should have cut your hair.\u201d She pulls the strands tight against my head and resumes weaving. \u201cIt\u2019s a liability in sparring and in battle, not to mention being a giant tar get. No one else has hair that fades out to silver like this , and they \u2019 ll already be aiming for you. \u201d \u201c You know very well the natura l pigment seems to gradually abandon it no matter the length. \u201d My eyes are just as indecisive , a light hazel of varying blues and ambers that never seems to favor either actual color .",
  "\u201cBesides, other than everyone else\u2019s concern for the shade, my hair is the only thing about me that\u2019s perfectly healthy . Cutting it would feel like I\u2019m punishing my body for finally doing something well, and it\u2019s not like I feel the need to hide who I am.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d Mira yanks on my braid, pulling my head back, and our eyes lock. \u201cYou\u2019re the smartest woman I know . Don\u2019 t forget that. Your brain is your best weapon. Outsmart them, V iolet. Do you hear me?\u201d I nod, and she loosens her grip, then finishes the braid and pulls me to my feet as she continues to summarize years of knowledge into fifteen harried minutes, barely pausing to breathe. \u201cBe observant. Quiet is fine, but make sure you notice everything and everyone around you to your advantage. Y ou\u2019ve read the Codex?\u201d \u201cA few times.\u201d The rule book for the Riders Quadrant is a fraction of the length of the other divisions\u2019. Probably because riders have trouble obeying rules. \u201cGood.",
  "Then you know that the other riders can kill you at any time, and the cutthroat cadets will try. Fewer cadets means better odds at Threshing. There are never enough drago ns willing to bond, and anyo ne reckless enough to get themselves killed isn\u2019 t worthy of a dragon anyway .\u201d \u201cExcept when sleeping. It\u2019s an executable offense to attack any cadet while sleeping. Article Three\u2014\u201d \u201cYes, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re safe at night.",
  "Sleep in this if you can.\u201dShe taps the stomach of my corset. \u201cRider black is supposed to be earned. You sure I shouldn\u2019 t wear my tunic today?\u201d I skim my hands over the leather . \u201cThe wind up on the parapet will catch any spare cloth like a sail.\u201d She hands me my now-much-lighter pack. \u201cThe tighter your clothe s, the better off you are up there, and in the ring once you start sparring. Wear the armor at all times. Keep your daggers on you at all times .\u201d She points to the sheaths down her thighs. \u201cSomeone\u2019 s going to say I didn\u2019 t earn them.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a Sorrengail,\u201d she responds, as if that\u2019s answer enough. \u201cFuck what they say .\u201d \u201cAnd you don\u2019 t think the dragon scales are cheating?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019 s no such thing as cheating once you climb the turret. There\u2019 s only survival and death.\u201d The bell chimes\u2014only thirty minute s left. She swallows. \u201cIt\u2019 s almost time. Ready?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNeither was I.\u201d A wry smile lifts a corner of her mouth. \u201cAnd I\u2019d spent my life training for it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to die today .\u201d I sling my pack over my shoulders and breathe a little easier than this morning.",
  "It\u2019 s infinitely more manageable. The halls of the central, administrative part of the fortress are eerily quiet as we wind our way down through various staircases, but the noise from outside grows louder the lower we descend. Through the windows, I see thousands of candidates hugging their loved ones and saying their goodbyes on the grassy fields just beneath the main gate. From what I\u2019ve witnessed every year, most families hold on to their candidates right up to the very last bell. The four roads leading to the fortress are clogged with horses and wagons, especially where they conver ge in front of the college, but it\u2019s the empty ones at the edge of the fields that make me nauseous. They\u2019re for the bodies.Right before we round the last corner that will lead to the courty ard, Mira stops. \u201cWhat is\u2014 Oof.\u201d She yanks me against her chest, hugging me tight in the relative privacy of the corridor . \u201cI love you, Violet. Remember everything I\u2019ve told you. Don\u2019 t become another name on the death roll.\u201d Her voice shakes, and I wrap my arms around her , squeezing tight. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I promise. She nods, her chin bumping against the top of my head. \u201cI know.",
  "Let\u2019s go.\u201d That\u2019 s all she says before pulling away and walking into the crowded courtyard just inside the main gate to the fortress. Instructors, commanders, and even our mother are gathered informally , waiting for the madness outside the walls to become the order within. Out of all the doors in the war college, the main gate is the only one no cadet will enter today , since each quadrant has its own entrance and facilities. Hell, the riders have their own citadel. Pretentious, egotistical fucks. I follow Mira, catching her with a few quick strides. \u201cFind Dain Aetos,\u201d Mira tells me as we cross through the courtyard, heading for the open gate. \u201cDain?\u201d I can\u2019t help but smile at the thought of seeing Dain again, and my heart rate jumps. It\u2019s been a year, and I\u2019ve missed his soft brown eyes and the way he laughs, the way every part of his body joins in. I\u2019ve missed our friendship, and the moments I thought it might turn into more under the right circumstances. I\u2019ve missed the way he looks at me, like I\u2019m someone worth noticing. I\u2019ve just missed\u2026him. \u201cI\u2019ve only been out of the quadr ant for three years, but from what I hear, he\u2019s doing well, and he\u2019ll keep you safe.",
  "Don\u2019 t smile like that,\u201d Mira chides. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a second-year .\u201d She shakes her finger at me. \u201cDon\u2019 t mess around with second-years. If you want to get laid, and you should\u201d\u2014shelifts her brows\u2014\u201coften, considering you never know what the day brings, then screw aroun d in your own year. Nothing is worse than cadets gossiping that you\u2019ve slept your way to safety .\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m free to take any of the first-years I want to bed,\u201d I say with a little grin. \u201cJust not the second- or third-years.\u201d \u201cExactly .\u201d She winks. We cross through the gates, leaving the fortress, and join the organized chaos beyond. Each of Navarre\u2019 s six provinces has sent this year\u2019s share of candidates for milit ary service. Some volunteer . Some are sentenced as punishment. Most are conscr ipted. The only thing we have in common here at Basgiath is that we passed the entrance exam\u2014both written and an agility test I still cannot believe I passed\u2014which means at least we won\u2019 t end up as fodder for the infantry on the front line.",
  "The atmosphere is tense with anticipation as Mira leads me along the worn cobbleston e path toward the southern turret. The main college is built into the side of Basgiath Mount ain, as if it was cleaved from a ridgeline of the peak itself. The sprawling, formidable structure towers over the crowd of anxious, waiting candidates and their tearful families, with its stories-tall stone battlements\u2014built to protect the high rise of the keep within\u2014and defensive turrets at each of its corners, one of which houses the bells. The majority of the crowd moves to line up at the base of the northern turret\u2014the entrance to the Infantry Quadrant. Some of the mass heads toward the gate behind us\u2014the Healer Quadrant that consumes the southern end of the college. Envy clench es my chest when I spot a few taking the central tunnel into the archives below the fortress to join the Scribe Quadrant. The entrance to the Riders Quadrant is nothing more than a fortified door at the base of the tower , just like the infantry entrance to the north. But while the infantry candidates can walk straight into their ground-levelquadrant, we rider candidates will climb . Mira and I join the riders\u2019 line, waiting to sign in, and I make the mistake of glancing up.",
  "High above us, crossing the river-bottomed valley that divides the main college from the even higher , looming citadel of the Riders Quadrant on the southern ridgeline, is the parapet, the stone bridge that\u2019s about to separate rider candidates from the cadets over the next few hours. I can\u2019 t believe I\u2019m about to cross that thing. \u201cAnd to think, I\u2019ve been preparing for the scribe\u2019 s written exam all these years.\u201d My voice drips with sarcasm. \u201cI should have been playing on a balance beam.\u201d Mira ignores me as the line moves forward and candidates disappear through the door . \u201cDon\u2019 t let the wind sway your steps.\u201d Two candidates ahead of us, a woman sobs as her partner rips her away from a young man, the couple breaking from the line, retreating in tears down the hillsid e toward the crowd of loved ones lining the roads. There are no other parents ahead of us, only a few dozen candida tes moving toward the roll-keepers. \u201cKeep your eyes on the stones ahead of you and don\u2019t look down,\u201d Mira says, the lines of her face tightening.",
  "\u201cArms out for balance. If the pack slips, drop it. Better it falls than you.\u201d I look behind us, where it seems hundreds have filed in within the span of minutes. \u201cMaybe I should let them go first,\u201d I whisper as panic fists my heart. What the hell am I doing? \u201cNo,\u201d Mira answers. \u201cThe longe r you wait on those steps\u201d\u2014sh e motions toward the tower\u2014\u201cthe greater your fear has a chance to grow . Cross the parapet before the terror owns you.\u201d The line moves, and the bell chimes again. It\u2019 s eight o\u2019clock. Sure enough, the crowd of thousands behind us has separated fully into their chosen quadrants, all lined up to sign the roll and begin their service.\u201cFocus,\u201d Mira snaps, and I whip my head forward. \u201cThis might sound harsh, but don\u2019 t seek friendships in there, V iolet. For ge alliances.\u201d There are only two ahead of us now\u2014a woman with a full pack, whose high cheekbones and oval face remind me of renderings of Amari, the queen of the gods. Her dark brown hair is worn in several rows of short braids that just touch the equall y dark skin of her neck. The second is the muscular blond man with the woman crying over him.",
  "He\u2019s carrying an even bigger rucksack. I look around the pair toward the roll-keeping desk, and my eyes widen. \u201cIs he\u2026?\u201d I whisper . Mira glances and mutters a curse. \u201cA separatist\u2019 s kid? Yep. See that shimmering mark that starts on the top of his wrist? It\u2019s a relic from the rebellion.\u201d I lift my eyebrows in surprise. The only relics I\u2019ve ever heard of are when a dragon uses magic to mark the skin of their bonded rider. But those relics are a symbol of honor and power and generally in the shape of the dragon who gifted them. These marks are swirls and slashes that feel more like a warning than a claiming. \u201cA dragon did that?\u201d I whisper . She nods. \u201cMom says General Melgren\u2019 s dragon did it to all of them when he executed their parents, but she wasn\u2019 t exactly open to further discussion on the topic. Nothing like punishing the kids to deter more parents from committing treason.\u201d It seems\u2026cruel, but the first rule of living at Basgiath is never question a dragon.",
  "They tend to cremate anyone they find rude. \u201cMost of the marked kids who carry rebellion relics are from Tyrrendor , of cours e, but there are a few whose parents turned traitor from the other provinces\u2014\u201d The blood drains from her face, and she grips the straps of my pack, turning me to face her. \u201cI just remembered.\u201d Her voice drops, and I lean in, my heart jumping at the urgency in her tone. \u201cStay the hell awayfrom Xaden Riorson.\u201d The air rushes from my lungs. That name\u2026 \u201cThat Xaden Riorson,\u201d she confirms, fear lacing her gaze. \u201cHe\u2019 s a third- year, and he will kill you the second he finds out who you are.\u201d \u201cHis father was the Great Betrayer . He led the rebellion,\u201d I say quietly . \u201cWhat is Xaden doing here?\u201d \u201cAll the children of the leaders were conscripted as punishmen t for their parents\u2019 crimes, \u201d Mira whispers as we shuffle sideways, moving with the line. \u201cMom told me they never expected Riorson to make it past the parapet. Then they figured a cadet would kill him, but once his dragon chose him\u2026\u201d She shakes her head.",
  "\u201cWell, there\u2019 s nothing much that can be done then. He\u2019 s risen to the rank of wingleader .\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s bullshit,\u201d I seethe. \u201cHe\u2019 s sworn allegiance to Navarre, but I don\u2019t think that will stop him where you\u2019re concerned. Once you get across the parapet\u2014because you will make it across\u2014find Dain. He\u2019ll put you in his squad, and we\u2019ll just hope it\u2019s far from Riorson.\u201d She grips my straps tighter . \u201cStay . Away. From. Him.\u201d \u201cNoted.\u201d I nod. \u201cNext,\u201d a voice calls from behind the wooden table that bears the rolls of the Riders Quadrant. The mark ed rider I don\u2019t know is seated next to a scribe I do, and Captain Fitzgibbons\u2019 s silver eyebrows rise over his weathered face. \u201cV iolet Sorrengail?\u201d I nod, picking up the quill and signing my name on the next empty line on the roll. \u201cBut I thought you were meant for the Scribe Quadrant,\u201d Captain Fitzgibbons says softly .",
  "I envy his cream-colored tunic, unable to find the words. \u201cGeneral Sorrengail chose otherwise,\u201d Mira supplies. Sadness fills the older man\u2019 s eyes. \u201cPity . You had so much promise.\u201d\u201cBy the gods,\u201d the rider next to Captain Fitzgibbons says. \u201cYou\u2019re Mira Sorrengail?\u201d His jaw drops, and I can smell his hero worship from here. \u201cI am.\u201d She nods. \u201cThis is my sister , Violet. She\u2019ll be a first-year .\u201d \u201cIf she survives the parapet.\u201d Someone behind me snickers. \u201cWind just might blow her right of f.\u201d \u201cYou fought at Strythmore,\u201d the rider behind the desk says with awe. \u201cThey gave you the Order of the Talon for taking out that battery behind enemy lines.\u201d The snickering stops. \u201cAs I was saying.\u201d Mira puts a hand at the small of my back. \u201cThis is my sister , Violet.\u201d \u201cYou know the way.\u201d The Capt ain nods and points to the open door into the turret. It looks ominously dark in there, and I fight the urge to run like hell. \u201cI know the way,\u201d she assures him, leading me past the table so the snickering asshole behind me can sign the roll. We pause at the doorway and turn toward each other .",
  "\u201cDon\u2019 t die, Violet. I\u2019d hate to be an only child.\u201d She grins and walks away , sauntering past the line of gawking candidates as word spreads of exactly who she is and what she\u2019 s done. \u201cTough to live up to that,\u201d the woman ahead of me says from just inside the tower . \u201cIt is,\u201d I agree, gripping the straps of my rucksack and heading into the darkness. My eyes adjust quick ly to the dim light coming in through the equidistant windows along the curved staircase. \u201cSorrengail as in\u2026?\u201d the woman asks, looking over her shoul der as we begin to climb the hundreds of stairs that lead to our possible deaths. \u201cYep.\u201d There\u2019 s no railing, so I keep my hand on the stone wall as we rise higher and higher . \u201cThe general?\u201d the blond guy ahead of us asks.\u201cThe same one,\u201d I answer , offering him a quick smile. Anyone whose mother holds on that tight can\u2019 t be that bad, right?",
  "\u201cWow. Nice leathers, too.\u201d He smiles back. \u201cThanks. They\u2019re courtesy of my sister .\u201d \u201cI wond er how many candidates have fallen off the edge of the steps and died before they even reach the parapet,\u201d the woman says, glancing down the center of the staircase as we climb higher . \u201cTwo last year.\u201d I tilt my head when she glances back. \u201cWell, three if you count the girl one of the guys landed on.\u201d The woman\u2019 s brown eyes flare, but she turns back around and keeps climbing. \u201cHow many steps are there?\u201d she asks. \u201cTwo hundred and fifty,\u201d I answer , and we climb in silence for another five minutes. \u201cNot too bad,\u201d she says with a bright smile as we near the top and the line comes to a halt. \u201cI\u2019m Rhiannon Matthias, by the way .\u201d \u201cDylan,\u201d the blond guy responds with an enthusiastic wave. \u201cViolet.\u201d I give them a tense smile of my own, blatantly ignoring Mira\u2019 s earlier suggestion that I avoid friendships and only for ge alliances. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been waiting my entire life for this day.\u201d Dylan shifts his pack on his back. \u201cCan you believe we actually get to do this? It\u2019s a dream come true.\u201d Right. Naturally , every other candidate but me is excited to be here.",
  "This is the only quadrant at Basgiath that doesn\u2019 t accept consc ripts\u2014only volunteers. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking wait.\u201d Rhianno n\u2019s smile widens. \u201cI mean, who wouldn\u2019 t want to ride a dragon ?\u201d Me. Not that it doesn\u2019 t sound fun in theory . It does.",
  "It\u2019s just the abhorrent odds of surviving to graduation that sour my stomach. \u201cDo your parents approve?\u201d Dylan asks. \u201cBecause my mom\u2019 s been begging me to change my mind for months . I keep telling her that I\u2019ll havebetter chances for advancement as a rider, but she wanted me to enter the Healer Quadrant.\u201d \u201cMine always knew I wanted this, so they\u2019ve been pretty supportive. Besides, they have my twin to dote on. Raegan\u2019 s already living her dream, married and expecting a baby .\u201d Rhiannon glances back at me. \u201cWhat about you? Let me guess. With a name like Sorrengail, I bet you were the first to volunteer this year .\u201d \u201cI was more like volun-told.\u201d My answer is far less enthusiastic than hers. \u201cGotcha.\u201d \u201cAnd riders do get way better perks than other officers,\u201d I say to Dylan as the line moves upward again. The snickering candidate behind me catches up, sweating and red. Look who isn\u2019t snickering now. \u201cBetter pay, more leniency with the uniform policy,\u201d I continue. No one gives a shit what riders wear as long as it\u2019s black. The only rules that apply to riders are the ones I\u2019ve memorized from the Codex.",
  "\u201cAnd the right to call yourself a supreme badass,\u201d Rhiannon adds. \u201cThat too,\u201d I agree. \u201cPretty sure they issue you an ego with your flight leathers.\u201d \u201cPlus, I\u2019ve heard that riders are allowed to marry sooner than the other quadrants,\u201d Dylan adds. \u201cTrue. Right after graduation.\u201d If we survive. \u201cI think it has something to do with wanting to continue bloodlines.\u201d Most successful riders are legacies. \u201cOr because we tend to die sooner than the other quadrants,\u201d Rhiannon muses. \u201cI\u2019m not dying,\u201d Dylan says with way more confidence than I feel as he tugs a necklace from under his tunic to reveal a ring danglin g from the chain. \u201c She said it would be bad luck to propose before I left , so we \u2019 re waiting until graduation.",
  "\u201d He kisses the ring and tucks the chain back under his colla r. \u201c The next three years are going to be long ones , but they \u2019 ll beworth it. \u201d I keep my sigh to myself , though that might be the most roma ntic thing I \u2019 ve ever heard . \u201cYou might make it across the parapet,\u201d the guy behind us sneers. \u201cThis one here is a breeze away from the bottom of the ravine.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cShut up and focus on yours elf,\u201d Rhiannon snaps, her feet clicking against the stone as we climb. The top comes into sight, the doorway full of muddled light. Mira was right. Those clouds are going to wreak havoc on us, and we have to be on the other side of the parapet before they do.",
  "Another step, another tap of Rhiannon\u2019 s feet. \u201cLet me see your boots,\u201d I say quietly so the jerk behind me can\u2019 t hear . Her brow pucke rs, and confusion fills her brown eyes, but she shows me the soles. They\u2019re smooth, just like the ones I was wearing earlier . My stomach sinks like a rock. The line starts moving again, pausing when we\u2019re only a few feet from the opening. \u201cWhat size are your feet?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rhiannon blinks at me. \u201cYour feet. What size are they?\u201d \u201cEight,\u201d she answers, two lines forming between her brows. \u201cI\u2019m a seven,\u201d I say quickly . \u201cIt will hurt like hell, but I want you to take my left boot. T rade with me.\u201d I have a dagger in the right one. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d She looks at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind, and maybe I have. \u201cThese are rider boots. They\u2019ll grip the stone better .",
  "Your toes will be scrunched and generally miserable, but at least you\u2019ll have a shot at not falling of f if that rain hits.\u201d Rhiannon glances toward the open door\u2014and the darkening sky\u2014then back to me. \u201cY ou\u2019re willing to trade a boot?\u201d \u201cJust until we get on the other side.\u201d I look through the open door. Threecandidates are already walking across the parapet, their arms stretched out wide. \u201cBut we have to be quick. It\u2019 s almost our turn.\u201d Rhiannon purses her lips in debate for a second, then agrees, and we swap left boots. I barely finish lacing up before the line moves again, and the guy behind me shoves my lower back, sending me staggering onto the platform and into the open air . \u201cLet\u2019 s go. Some of us have things to do on the other side.\u201d His voice grates on my last freaking nerve. \u201cYou are not worth the effort right now,\u201d I mutter , gaining my balance as the wind whips at my skin, the midsummer morning thick with humidity . Good call on the braid, Mira. The top of the turret is bare, the crenelations of stone rising and falling along the circular structure at the height of my chest and doing nothing to obscure the view . The ravine and its river below suddenly feel very, very far.",
  "How many wagons do they have waiting down there? Five? Six? I know the stats. The parapet claims roughly fifteen percent of the rider candidates. Every trial in the quadrant\u2014including this one\u2014is designed to test a cadet\u2019 s ability to ride. If someone can\u2019t manage to walk the windy length of the slim stone bridge, then they sure as hell can\u2019t keep their balance and fight on the back of a dragon. And as for the death rate? I guess every other rider thinks the risk is worth the glory\u2014or has the arrogance to think they won\u2019 t fall. I\u2019m not in either camp. Nausea has me holding my stomach, and I breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth as I walk the edge behind Rhiannon and Dylan, my fingers skimming the stonework as we wind our way toward the parapet. Three riders wait at the entranc e, which is nothing more than a gaping hole in the wall of the turret. One with ripped-of f sleeves records names as candidates step out onto the treacherous crossing. Another , who\u2019 s shaved allhis hair with the exception of a strip down the top center , instruc ts Dylan as he move s into position, patting his chest like the ring hidden there will bring him luck. I hope it does.",
  "The third turns in my direction and my heart simply\u2026stops. He\u2019s tall, with windblown black hair and dark brows. The line of his jaw is strong and covered by warm tawny skin and dark stubble, and when he folds his arms across his torso, the muscles in his chest and arms ripple, moving in a way that makes me swallow . And his eyes\u2026 His eyes are the shade of gold-flecked onyx. The contrast is startling, jaw-dropping even\u2014 everything abou t him is. His features are so harsh that they look carved, and yet they\u2019re astonishingly perfec t, like an artist worked a lifetime sculpting him, and at least a year of that was spent on his mouth. He\u2019s the most exquisite man I\u2019ve ever seen. And living in the war college means I\u2019ve seen a lot of men. Even the diagon al scar that bisects his left eyebrow and mark s the top corner of his cheek only make s him hotter . Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot. Suddenly , I can\u2019t remember exactly why Mira told me not to fuck around outside my year group.",
  "\u201cSee you two on the other side!\u201d Dylan says over his shoulde r with an excited grin before stepping onto the parapet, his arms spread wide. \u201cReady for the next one, Riorson?\u201d the rider with the ripped sleeves says.",
  "Xaden Riorson? \u201cYou ready for this, Sorrengail?\u201d Rhiannon asks, moving forward. The black-haired rider snaps his gaze to mine, turning fully toward me, and my heart thunders for all the wrong reasons. A rebellion relic, curving in dips and swirls, starts at his bare left wrist, then disappears under his black uniform to appear again at his collar , where it stretches and swirls up his neck, stopping at his jawline. \u201cOh shit,\u201d I whisper , and his eyes narrow , as if he can hear me over thehowl of wind that rips at my secured braid. \u201cSorrengail?\u201d He steps toward me, and I look up\u2026and up. Good gods, I don\u2019t even reach his collarbone. He\u2019s massive. He has to be more than four inches over six feet tall. I feel exactly what Mira called me\u2014 fragile \u2014but I nod once, and the shining onyx of his eyes trans forms to cold, unadulterated hatred. I can almost taste the loathing wafting of f him like a bitter cologne. \u201cViolet?\u201d Rhiannon asks, moving forward. \u201cYou\u2019re General Sorrengail\u2019 s youngest.\u201d His voice is deep and accusatory . \u201cYou\u2019re Fen Riorson\u2019 s son,\u201d I counter , the certainty of this revelation settling in my bones.",
  "I lift my chin and do my best to lock every muscle in my body so I don\u2019 t start trembling. He will kill you the second he finds out who you are. Mira\u2019 s words bounce around my skull, and fear knots in my throat. He\u2019s going to throw me over the edge. He\u2019s going to pick me up and drop me right off this turret. I\u2019m never going to get the chance to even walk the parapet. I\u2019ll die being exactly what my mother \u2019s always danced around calling me\u2014weak. Xaden sucks in a deep breath, and the muscle in his jaw flexes once.",
  "Twice. \u201cY our mother captured my father and oversaw his execution.\u201d Wait. Like he has the only right to hatred here? Rage races through my veins. \u201cY our father killed my older brother . Seems like we\u2019re even.\u201d \u201cHardly .\u201d His glaring gaze strokes over me like he\u2019s memoriz ing every detail or looking for any weakness. \u201cYour sister is a rider. Guess that explains the leathers.\u201d \u201cGuess so.\u201d I hold his glare, as if winning this staring compet ition will gain me entrance to the quadrant instead of crossing the parapet behind him. Either way , I\u2019m getting across. Mira isn\u2019 t going to lose both her siblings. His hands clench into fists, and he tenses. I prepar e for the strike. He might throw me off this tower , but I won\u2019 tmake it easy for him. \u201cYou all right?\u201d Rhiannon asks, her gaze jumping between Xaden and me. He glances at her . \u201cYou\u2019re friends?\u201d \u201cWe met on the stairs,\u201d she says, squaring her shoulders. He looks down, noting our mismatched shoes, and arches a brow . His hands relax.",
  "\u201cInteresting.\u201d \u201cAre you going to kill me?\u201d I lift my chin another inch. His gaze clashes with mine as the sky opens and rain falls in a deluge, soaking my hair , my leathers, and the stones around us in seconds. A scream rends the air, and Rhiannon and I both jerk our attent ion to the parapet just in time to see Dylan slip. I gasp, my heart jolting into my throat. He catch es himself, hooking his arms over the stone bridge as his feet kick beneath him, scrambling for a purchase that isn\u2019 t there. \u201cPull yourself up, Dylan!\u201d Rhiannon shouts. \u201cOh gods!\u201d My hand flies to cover my mouth, but he loses his grip on the water -slick stone and falls, disappearing from view . The wind and rain steal any soun d his body might make in the valley below . They steal the sound of my muf fled cry , too. Xaden never takes his eyes from me, watching silently with a look I can\u2019t interpret as I bring my horrified gaze back to his. \u201cWhy would I waste my energy killing you when the parapet will do it for me?\u201d A wicked smile curves his lips.",
  "\u201cY our turn.\u201dTher e\u2019s a misconception that it\u2019 s kill or be killed in the Riders Quadrant. Riders, as a whole, ar en\u2019t out to assassinate other cadets\u2026unless ther e\u2019s a shortage of dragons that year or a cadet is a liability to their wing. Then things may get\u2026inter esting. \u2014M AJOR AFENDRA \u2019S GUIDE TO THE RIDERS QUADRANT (UNAUTHORIZED EDITION ) CHAPTER TWO I will not die today . The words become my mantra, repeating in my head as Rhiannon gives her name to the rider keeping tally at the opening to the parapet. The hatred in Xaden\u2019 s stare burns the side of my face like a palpable flame, and even the rain pelting my skin with each gust of wind doesn\u2019 t ease the heat\u2014or the shiver of dread that jolts down my spine. Dylan is dead. He\u2019s just a name, another soon-to-be stone in the endless graveyards that line the roads to Basgiath, another warning to the ambitious candidates who would rather chance their lives with the riders than choose the security of any other quadra nt.",
  "I get it now\u2014why Mira warned me not to make friends. Rhiannon grips both sides of the opening in the turret, then looks over her shoulder at me. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you on the other side,\u201d she shouts over the storm. The fear in her eyes mirrors my own. \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the other side.\u201d I nod and even manage a grim ace of a smile. She steps out onto the parapet and begins walking, and even though I\u2019m sure his hands are full today , I send up a silent prayer to Zihnal, the god ofluck. \u201cName?\u201d the rider at the edge asks as his partner holds a cloak over the scroll in a pointless attempt to keep the paper dry . \u201cViolet Sorreng ail,\u201d I answer as thunder cracks above me, the sound oddly comforting. I\u2019ve always loved the nights where storms beat against the fortress window , both illuminating and throwing shadows over the books I curled up with, though this downpour might just cost me my life. With a quick glance, I see Dylan\u2019 s and Rhiannon\u2019 s names alrea dy blurring at the end where water has met ink. It\u2019s the last time Dylan\u2019 s name will be written anywher e but his stone. There will be another roll at the end of the parapet so the scribes have their beloved statistics for casualties .",
  "In another life, it would be me reading and recording the data for historical analysis. \u201cSorrengail?\u201d The rider looks up, his eyebrows rising in surpris e. \u201cAs in General Sorrengail?\u201d \u201cThe same.\u201d Damn, that\u2019s already getting old, and I know it\u2019s only going to get worse. There\u2019s no avoiding the comparison to my mother , not when she\u2019s the commander here. Even worse, they probably think I\u2019m a naturally gifted rider like Mira or a brilliant strategist like Brennan was. Or they\u2019ll take one look at me, realize I\u2019m nothing like the three of them, and declare open season.",
  "I place my hands on either side of the turret and drag my fingertips across the stone. It\u2019s still warm from the morning sun but rapidly cooli ng from the rain, slick but not slippery from moss growth or anything. Ahead of me, Rhiannon is making her way across, her hands out for balance. She\u2019s probably a fourth of the way, her figure becoming blurrier the farther she walks into the rain. \u201cI thought she only had one daughter?\u201d the other rider asks, angling the cloak as another gust of wind blows into us. If it\u2019s this windy here, my bottom half sheltered by the turret, then I\u2019m about to be in for a world of hurt on the parapet.\u201cI get that a lot.\u201d In through my nose, out through my mouth, I force my breathing to calm, my heart rate to slow from its gallop. If I panic, I\u2019ll die. If I slip, I\u2019ll die. If I\u2026 Oh, fuck it. There\u2019 s nothing more I can do to prepare for this.",
  "I take the lone step up onto the parapet and grip the stone wall as another gust hits, knocking me sideways against the opening in the turret. \u201cAnd you think you\u2019ll be able to ride?\u201d the asshole candidate behind me mocks. \u201cSome Sorrengail, with that kind of balance. I pity whatever wing you end up in.\u201d I regain my balance and yank the straps of my pack tighter . \u201cName?\u201d the rider asks again, but I know he\u2019 s not talking to me. \u201cJack Barlowe,\u201d the one behind me answers. \u201cRemember the name. I\u2019m going to be a wingleader one day .\u201d Even his voice reeks of arrogance. \u201cYou\u2019d better get going, Sorrengail,\u201d Xaden\u2019 s deep voice orders. I look over my shoulder and see him pinning me with a glare. \u201cUnless you need a little motivation?\u201d Jack lunges forward, his hands raised. Holy shit, he\u2019 s going to shove me of f. Fear shoots through my veins, and I move, leaving the safety of the turret as I bolt onto the parapet.",
  "There\u2019 s no going back now . My heart beats so hard that I hear it in my ears like a drum. Keep your eyes on the stones ahead of you and don\u2019t look down . Mira\u2019 s advice echoes in my head, but it\u2019s hard to heed it when every step could be my last. I throw my arms out for balance, then take the measured mini strides I practiced with Major Gillstead in the courtyard. But with the wind, the rain, and the two-hundred-foot drop, this is nothing like practice. The stones beneath my feet are unev en in places, held together by mortar in the joints that make it easy to trip, and I concentrate on the path ahead of me to keep my eyes off my boots. My muscles are tight as I lock my center of gravity , keeping my posture upright. My head swims as my pulse skyrockets.Calm. I have to stay calm. I can\u2019t carry a tune, or even decently hum, so singing for a distraction is out, but I am a scholar . There\u2019 s nowhere as calming as the archives, so that\u2019s what I think of. Facts. Logic. History . Your mind already knows the answer , so just calm down and let it remember . That\u2019 s what Dad always told me.",
  "I need something to keep the logical side of my brain from turning around and walking straight back to the turret. \u201cThe Continent is home to two kingdoms\u2014and we\u2019ve been at war for four hundred years,\u201d I recite, using the basic, simple data that has been drilled into me for easy recall in preparation for the scribe\u2019 s test. Step after step, I make my way across the parapet. \u201cNavarre, my home, is the larger kingdom, with six unique provinces. Tyrrendor , our southernmost and largest province, shares its border with the province of Krovla within the Poromiel kingdom.\u201d Each word calms my breathing and steadies my heart rate, lessening the dizziness. \u201cTo our east lie the remaining two Poromiel provinces of Braevick and Cygnisen, with the Esben Moun tains providing a natural border .\u201d I pass the painted line that marks halfway .",
  "I\u2019m over the highest point now, but I can\u2019t think about that. Don\u2019 t look down. \u201cBeyond Krovla, beyond our enemy , lie the distant Barrens, a desert\u2014\u201d Thunder cracks, the wind slams into me, and I flail my arms. \u201cShit!\u201d My body sways left with the gale, and I drop to the parapet, holding on to the edges and crouching so I don\u2019t lose my footing, making myself as small as possible as the wind howls over and around me. Stomach churning, I feel my lungs threaten to hyperventilate as panic seizes me at knifepoint. \u201cWithin Navarre , Tyrrendor was the last of the bordering provinces to join the alliance and swear fealty to King Reginald,\u201d I shout into the howling wind, forcing my mind to keep moving against the very real threat of paraly zing anxiety . \u201cIt was also the only province to attempt secessionsix hund red and twenty-seven years later, which would have eventually left our kingdom defenseless had they been successful.\u201d Rhiannon is still ahead of me, at what I think is the three-quart ers point. Good. She deserves to make it.",
  "\u201c The kingdom of Poromiel mainly consists of arable plains and marshlands and is known for exceptional textiles , endless fields of grain , and unique crystalline gems capable of amplifying minor magics. \u201d I spare only a quick glance at the dark clouds above me before inchi ng forward , one foot carefully placed in front of the other .",
  "\u201cIn contrast, Navarre\u2019 s mountainous regions offer an abundance in ore, hardy timber from our eastern provinces, and limitless deer and elk.\u201d My next step knocks a couple of pieces of mortar loose, and I pause as my arms wobble until I regain my balance. I swallow and test my weight before moving forward again. \u201cThe Trade Agreement of Resson, signed more than two hundred years ago, ensures the exchange of meat and lumber from Navarre for the cloth and agriculture within Poromiel four times a year at the Athebyne outpost on the border of Krovla and T yrrendor .\u201d I can see the Riders Quadrant from here. The enormous stone footings of the citadel rise up the mountain to the base of the structure, where I know this path ends if I can just get there. Scraping the rain from my face with the leather on my shoulder , I glance back to see where Jack is. He\u2019s stalled at just after the quarter mark, his stocky form standi ng still\u2026 like he\u2019s waiting for something. His hands are at his sides. The wind seems to have no effect on his balance , lucky bastard. I swear he\u2019s grinning across the distance, but it could just be the rain in my eyes.",
  "I can\u2019t stay here. Living to see the sunrise means I have to keep moving. Fear can\u2019t rule my body . Squeezing the muscles of my legs together for balance, I slowly let go of the stone beneath me and stand. Arms out. W alk.I need to get as far as possible before the next gust of wind. I look back over my shoulder to see where Jack is, and my blood chills to ice. He\u2019s turned his back on me and is facing the next candidate, who wobbles dangerously as he approaches. Jack grabs the gangly boy by the straps of his overpacked rucksack, and I watch, shock locking my musc les, as Jack throws the scrawny candidate from the parapet like a sack of grain. A scream reaches my ears for an instant before fading as he falls out of sight. Holy shit. \u201cYou\u2019re next, Sorrengail!\u201d Jack bellows, and I jerk my gaze from the ravine to see him pointing at me, a sinister smile curving his mouth. Then he comes for me, his strides eating up the distance between us with horrifying speed.",
  "Move. Now . \u201cTyrrendor enco mpasses the southwest of the Continent,\u201d I recite, my steps even but panicked on the slick, narrow path, my left foot slipping a little at the beginning of each step. \u201cMade up of hostile, mountainous terrain and bordered by the Emerald Sea to the west and the Arctile Ocean to the south, Tyrrendor is nearly impenetrable. Though separated geographically by the Clif fs of Dralor , a natural protective barrier\u2014\u201d Another gust slams into me, and my foot slips off the parapet. My heart lurches. The parapet rushes up to meet me as I stumble and fall. My knee slams into the stone, and I yelp at the sharp bite of pain. My hands scramble for purchase as my left leg dangles off the edge of this bridg e from hell, Jack not far behind now. Then I make the gut-twisting error of looking down. Water runs off my nose and chin, splattering against the stone before falling to join the river gushing through the valley more than two hundred feet below. I swallow the growing knot in my throat and blink , fighting tosteady my heart rate.",
  "I will not die today . Gripping the sides of the stone, I brace as much of my weight as I can trust on the slick stones to hold and swing my left leg up. The ball of my foot finds the walkway . From here, there aren\u2019 t enough facts in the world to steady my thoug hts. I need to get my right foot under me, the one that has better traction, but one wrong move and I\u2019ll find out just how cold that river is beneath me. You\u2019ll be dead on impact. \u201cI\u2019m coming for you, Sorrengail!\u201d I hear from behind me. I shove off the stone and pray my boots find the pathway as I burst to my feet. If I fall, fine, that would be my error . But I\u2019m not about to let this asshole murder me. Best to get to the other side, wher e the rest of the murderers wait . Not that everyo ne in the quadr ant is going to try to kill me, just the cadets who think I\u2019ll be a liability to the wing.",
  "There \u2019s a reason strength is revered among riders. A squad, a section, a wing is only as effective as its weakest link, and if that link breaks, it puts everyone in danger . Jack either thinks I\u2019m that link or he\u2019s an unstable asshole who just enjoys killing. Probably both. Either way , I need to move faster . Throwing my arms out to the side, I focus on the end of the path, the courtyard of the citadel, where Rhiannon steps to safety , and I hustle despite the rain. I keep my body tight, my center locked, and for once am grateful I\u2019m shorter than most. \u201cWill you scream the whole way down?\u201d Jack mocks, still shouting, but his voice is closer . He\u2019 s gaining on me. There\u2019 s no room for fear, so I block it out, envisioning shoving the emotion behind locked iron bars in my mind. I can see the end of the parapet now , the riders who wait at the entrance to the citadel. \u201cThere\u2019 s no way someone who can\u2019t even carry a full rucksack passed theentrance exam.",
  "You\u2019re a mistake, Sorrengail,\u201d Jack calls out, his voice clearer , but I don\u2019t chance losin g my speed to check how far he is behind me. \u201cIt\u2019s really for the best that I take you out now, don\u2019t you think? It\u2019s so much more merciful than letting the dragons have at you. They\u2019ll start to eat you leg by rickety leg while you\u2019re still alive. Come on,\u201d he cajoles. \u201cIt will be my pleasur e to help you out.\u201d \u201cThe fuck you will,\u201d I mutter . There are only a dozen feet left to the outside of the citadel\u2019 s enormous walls. My left foot slips, and I wobble, but I only lose a heartbeat before I\u2019m moving forward again. The fortress looms behind those thick battlements, carved into the mountain in an L-shaped formation of tall stone buildings, built to withstand fire, for obvious reasons. The walls that surround the citadel\u2019 s courtyard are ten feet thick and eight feet tall, with one opening\u2014and I\u2019m just.",
  "About. There. I bite back a sob of relief as stone rises up on both sides of me. \u201cYou think you\u2019ll be safe in there?\u201d Jack\u2019 s voice is harsh\u2026and close. Secure on both sides by the walls, I run the last ten feet, my heart pounding as adrenaline pushes my body to its max, and his footsteps charge behind me. He lunges for my pack and misses, his hand hitting my hip as we reach the edge. I hurtle forward, jumping the twelve inches off the elevated parapet down to the courtyard, where two riders wait. Jack roars in frustration, and the sound grips my heaving chest like a vise. Spinning, I rip a dagger from its sheath at my ribs just as Jack skids to a halt above me on the parapet, his breath choppy and his face ruddy . Murder is etched in his narrowed, glaci al blue eyes as he glares down at me\u2026and where the tip of my dagger now indents the fabric of his breeches\u2014against his balls. \u201cI think. I\u2019ll be safe. For right.",
  "Now ,\u201d I manage between ragged breaths, my muscles trembling but my hand more than steady . \u201cWill you?\u201d Jack vibrates with rage, his thick blond brows slashing down over arctic blue eyes, every line of his monstrous frame leani ng my way.But he doesn\u2019 t take another step.",
  "\u201cIt is unlawful for a rider to cause another harm. While in a quadrant formation or in the supervisory . Presence of a superior -ranking cadet,\u201d I recite from the Codex, my heartbeat still in my throat. \u201cAs it will diminish the efficacy of the wing. And given the crowd behind us, I think it\u2019s clear to argue that it\u2019 s a formation. Article Three, Section\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit!\u201d He move s, but I hold my ground, and my dagger slices through the first layer of his breeches. \u201cI suggest you reconsider .\u201d I adjust my stance just in case he doesn\u2019 t. \u201cI might slip.\u201d \u201cName?\u201d the rider next to me drawls, as if we\u2019re the least interesting thing she\u2019s seen today . I glance in her direction for a millisecond. She pushes the chin- length, fire-red strands of her hair behind her ear with one hand and holds the roll with the other , watching the scene play out. The three silver four-point stars embroidered on the shoulder of her cloak tell me she\u2019s a third-year . \u201cYou\u2019re pretty small for a rider, but it looks like you made it.\u201d \u201cViolet Sorreng ail,\u201d I answer , but a hundred percent of my focus is on Jack again. The rain drips off the lowered ridge of his brow .",
  "\u201cAnd before you ask, yes, I\u2019m that Sorrengail.\u201d \u201cNot surprised, with that maneuver ,\u201d the woman says, holding a pen like Mom uses over the roll. It might be the nicest compliment I\u2019ve ever been given. \u201cAnd what\u2019s your name?\u201d she asks again. Pretty sure she\u2019s asking Jack, but I\u2019m too busy studying my opponent to glance her way . \u201cJack. Barlowe.\u201d There\u2019 s no sinister little smile on his lips or playful taunts about how he\u2019ll enjoy killing me now. There\u2019 s nothing but pure malice in his features, promising retribution. A chill of apprehension lifts the hairs on my neck. \u201cWell, Jack,\u201d the male rider on my right says slowly , scratching the trimlines of his dark goatee. He\u2019s not wearing a cloak, and the rain soaks into the bevy of patches stitched into a worn leather jacket. \u201cCadet Sorrengail has you by the actual balls here, in more ways than one. She\u2019s right.",
  "Regs state that there\u2019 s nothing but respect among riders at formation. You want to kill her, you\u2019ll have to do it in the sparring ring or on your own time. That is, if she decides to let you off the parapet. Because technically , you\u2019re not on the grounds yet, so you are not a cadet. She is.\u201d \u201cAnd if I decide to snap her neck the second I step down?\u201d Jack growls, and the look in his eyes says he\u2019ll do it. \u201cThen you get to meet the dragons early ,\u201d the redhead answers, her tone bland. \u201cW e don\u2019 t wait for trials around here. W e just execute.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019 s it going to be, Sorrengail?\u201d the male rider asks. \u201cYou going to have Jack here start as a eunuch?\u201d Shit.",
  "What is it going to be? I can\u2019t kill him, not at this angle, and slicing off his balls is only going to make him hate me more, if possible. \u201cAre you going to follow the rules?\u201d I ask Jack. My head is buzzing, and my arm feels so damned heavy , but I keep my knife on tar get. \u201cGuess I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d A corner of his mouth tilts into a sneer , and his posture relaxes as he raises his hands, palms out. I lower my dagger but keep it palmed and ready as I move sideways, toward the redhead keeping roll. Jack steps down into the court yard, his shoulder knocking mine as he walks by, pausing to lean in close. \u201cYou\u2019re dead, Sorrengail, and I\u2019m going to be the one to kill you.\u201dBlue dragons descend fr om the extraordinary Gormfaileas line. Known for their formidable size, they ar e the most ruthless, especially in the case of the rar e Blue Daggertail, whose knifelike spikes at the tip of their tail can disembowel an enemy with one flick. \u2014C OLONEL KAORI\u2019S FIELD GUIDE TO DRAGONKIND CHAPTER THREE If Jack wants to kill me, he needs to get in line. Besides, I have a feeling Xaden Riorson is going to beat him to it.",
  "\u201cNot today ,\u201d I respond to Jack, the hilt of my dagger solid in my hand, and I somehow manage to suppress a shudder as he leans over and breathes in. He\u2019s scenting me like a fucking dog. Then he scoffs and walks off into the crow d of celebrating cadets and riders that\u2019s gathered in the sizable courtyard of the citadel. It\u2019s still early , probably around nine, but already I see there aren\u2019 t as many cadets as there were candidates ahead of me in line. Based on the overwhelming presence of leath er, both the second- and third-years are here as well, taking stock of the new cadets.",
  "The rain eases into a drizzle, as if it had only come to make the hardest test of my life even harder\u2026but I did it. I\u2019m alive. I made it. My body begins to tremble, and a throbbing pain erupts in my left knee\u2014 the one I slammed on the parapet. I take a step, and it threatens to give out on me. I need to bind it before anyone notices.\u201cI think you made an enemy there,\u201d the redhead says, casuall y shifting the letha l crossbow she wears strapped along her shoulder . She glances at me over the scroll with a shrewd look in her hazel eyes as she looks me up and down. \u201cI\u2019d watch your back with that one if I were you.\u201d I nod. I\u2019m going to have to watch my back and every other part of my body . The next candidate approaches from the parapet as someone grips my shoulders from behind and spins me. My dagger is halfway up when I realize it\u2019 s Rhiannon. \u201cWe made it!\u201d She grins, giving my shoulders a squeeze. \u201cWe made it,\u201d I repeat with a forced smile. My thighs are shaking now, but I manage to sheath my dagger at my ribs. Now that we\u2019re here, both cadets, can I trust her?",
  "\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough. There were at least three times I would have fallen off if you hadn\u2019 t helped me. You were right\u2014those soles were slick as shit. Have you seen the people around here? I swear I just saw a second- year with pink streaks in her hair, and one guy has dragon scales tattooed up his entire biceps.\u201d \u201cConformity is for the infantry ,\u201d I say as she loops her arm through mine and tugs me along toward the crowd. My knee screams, pain radiating up to my hip and down to my foot, and I limp, my weight falling into Rhiannon\u2019 s side. Damn it. Where did this nausea come from? Why can\u2019t I stop shaking? I\u2019m going to fall any secon d now\u2014there\u2019 s no way my body can remain upright with this earthquake in my legs or the whirring in my head. \u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d she says, glancing down. \u201cWe need to trade boots.",
  "There\u2019 s a bench\u2014\u201d A tall figure in a pristine black uniform steps out of the crowd, charging toward us, and though Rhiannon manages to dodge, I stumble smack intohis chest. \u201cViolet?\u201d Strong hands catch my elbows to steady me, and I look up into a pair of familiar , striking brown eyes, flared wide in obvious shock. Relief sweeps through me, and I try to smile, but it probably comes out like a distorted grimace. He seem s taller than he was last summer , the beard that cuts across his jaw is new, and he\u2019s filled out in a way that makes me blink\u2026or mayb e that\u2019s just my vision going hazy at the edges. The beautiful, easygo ing smile that\u2019s starred in way too many of my fantasies is far from the scowl that purses his mouth, and everything about him seems a little\u2026harder , but it works for him. The line of his chin, the set of his brow , even the muscles of his biceps are rigid under my fingers as I try to find my balance. Someti me in the last year, Dain Aetos went from attractive and cute to gorgeous . And I\u2019m about to be sick all over his boots. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d he barks, the shock in his eyes transforming to something foreign, something deadly .",
  "This isn\u2019t the same boy I grew up with. He\u2019 s a second-year rider now . \u201cDain. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d That\u2019s an understatement, but the trembles turn to full-on shakes, and bile creeps up my throat, dizziness only making the nausea worse. My knees give out. \u201cDamn it, Violet,\u201d he mutters, hauling me back to my feet. With one hand on my back and the other under my elbow , he quickly guides me away from the crowd and into an alcove in the wall, close to the first defensive turret of the citadel. It\u2019s a shady , hidden spot with a hard wooden bench, which he sits me on, then helps me out of my rucksack. Spit floods my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d \u201cHead between your knees,\u201d Dain orders in a harsh tone I\u2019m not used to from him, but I do it. He rubs circles on my lower back as I breathe in through my nose and out throug h my mouth.",
  "\u201cIt\u2019s the adrenaline. Give it a minute and it\u2019ll pass.\u201d I hear approaching footsteps on the gravel. \u201cWho thehell are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Rhiannon. I\u2019m V iolet\u2019 s\u2026friend.\u201d I stare at the gravel under my mismatched boots and will the meager contents of my stomach to stay put. \u201cListen to me, Rhiannon. Violet is fine,\u201d he commands. \u201cAnd if anyone asks, then you tell them exactly what I said, that it\u2019s just the adrenaline working out of her system. Understand?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no one\u2019s business what\u2019 s going on with Violet,\u201d she retorts, her tone just as sharp as his. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019 t say shit. Especially not when she\u2019s the reason I made it across the parapet.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d better mean that,\u201d he warns, the bite in his voice at odds with the ceaseless, comforting circles he makes on my back. \u201cI could ask you just who the hell you are,\u201d she retorts. \u201cHe\u2019 s one of my oldest friends.\u201d The trembles slowly subside , and the nausea wanes, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from timing or my position, so I keep my head between my knees while I manage to unlace my left boot.",
  "\u201cOh,\u201d Rhiannon answers. \u201cAnd a second-year rider , cadet ,\u201d he growls.",
  "Gravel crunches, like Rhiannon has backed up a step. \u201cNo one can see you here, V i, so take your time,\u201d Dain says softly . \u201cBecause puking my guts up after surviving the parapet and the asshole who wanted to throw me off it would be considered weak.\u201d I rise slowly , sitting upright. \u201cExactly ,\u201d he answers. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d His gaze rakes over me with a desperate edge, like he needs to see every inch for himself. \u201cMy knee is sore,\u201d I admit in a whisper , because it\u2019s Dain. Dain, whom I\u2019ve known since we were five and six. Dain, whose father is one of my mother \u2019s most trusted advisers. Dain, who held me together when Mira left for the Riders Quadrant and again when Brennan died. He takes my chin between his thumb and forefinger , turning my face leftand right for his inspection. \u201cThat\u2019 s all? You\u2019re sure?\u201d His hands run down my sides and pause at my ribs. \u201cAre you wearing daggers ?\u201d Rhiannon takes my boot of f and sighs in relief, wiggling her toes. I nod. \u201cThree at my ribs and one in my boot.\u201d Thank gods, or I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be sitting here right now .",
  "\u201cHuh.\u201d He drops his hands and looks at me like he\u2019s never seen me before, like I\u2019m a complete stranger, but then he blinks and it\u2019s gone. \u201cGet your boots switc hed. You two look ridiculous. Vi, do you trust this one?\u201d He nods toward Rhiannon. She could have waited for me at the security of the citadel walls and thrown me of f just like Jack tried to do, but she didn\u2019 t. I nod. I trust her as much as anyone can trust another first-year around here. \u201cAll right.\u201d He stands and turns toward her. There are sheaths at the sides of his leathers, too, but there are daggers in each of them, where mine are still empty. \u201cI\u2019m Dain Aetos, and I\u2019m the leader for Second Squad, Flame Section, Second W ing.\u201d Squad leader? My brows jump.",
  "The highest ranks among the cadets in the quadrant are wingleader and section leader . Both positions are held by elite third-years. Second-years can rise to squad leaders, but only if they\u2019re exceptional. Everyone else is simply a cadet before Threshing\u2014when the dragons choose who they will bond\u2014and a rider after. People die too often around here to hand out ranks prematurely . \u201cParapet should be over in the next couple of hours, depending on how fast the candida tes cross or fall.",
  "Go find the redhead with the roll\u2014she\u2019 s usually carrying a crossbow\u2014and tell her that Dain Aetos put both you and Violet Sorrengail into his squad. If she questions you, tell her she owes me from saving her ass at Threshing last year. I\u2019ll bring Violet back to the courtyard shortly .\u201d Rhiannon glances at me, and I nod.\u201cGo before someone sees us,\u201d Dain barks. \u201cGoing,\u201d she answers, shoving her foot into her boot and lacing it quickly as I do the same with mine. \u201cYou crossed the parapet with an equestrian boot too big for you?\u201d Dain asks, glaring down at me with incredulity . \u201cShe would have died without trading mine.\u201d I stand and wince as my knee objects and tries to buckle. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to die if we don\u2019t find you a way out of here.\u201d He offers his arm. \u201cTake it. We need to get you to my room. You need to wrap that knee.\u201d His eyebrows rise. \u201cUnless you found some miracle cure I don\u2019t know about in the last year?\u201d I shake my head and take his arm. \u201cDamn it, Violet.",
  "Damn it.\u201d He tucks mine discreetly against his side, grabs my rucksa ck with his empty hand, then leads me into a tunnel at the end of the alcove in the outer wall I hadn\u2019 t even seen. Mage lights flicker on in the sconces as we pass and extinguish after we go by. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here.\u201d \u201cWell aware.\u201d I let myself limp a little, since no one can see us now . \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be in the Scribe Quadrant,\u201d he seethes, leading me through the tunnel in the wall. \u201cWhat the hell happened? Please tell me you did not volunteer for the Riders Quadrant.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d I challenge as we reach a wrought-iron gate that looks like it was built to keep out a troll\u2026or a dragon. He curses. \u201cY our mother .\u201d \u201cMy mother .\u201d I nod. \u201cEvery Sorrengail is a rider , don\u2019 t you know?\u201d We make it to a set of circular steps, and Dain leads me up past the first and second floor, stopping us on the third and pushing open another gate that creaks with the sound of metal on metal. \u201cThis is the second-year floor ,\u201d he explains quietly .",
  "\u201c Which means\u2014 \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m not supposed to be up here , obviously . \u201d I tuck in a little closer . \u201c Don \u2019 t worry\u2014if someone sees us , I \u2019 ll just say that I was overcome with lust at first sight and couldn \u2019 t wait another second to get you out of your pants. \u201d \u201c Ever the smart -ass. \u201d A wry smile tugs at his lips as we start down the hall . \u201cI can throw in a few oh, Dain cries once we\u2019re in your room just for believability ,\u201d I of fer, and actually mean it. He snorts as he drops my pack in front of a wooden door, then makes a twisting motion with his hand in front of the handle. A lock audibly clicks. \u201cYou have powers,\u201d I say . It\u2019s not news, of course.",
  "He\u2019s a second-year rider, and all riders can perform lesser magics once their dragons choose to channel their power\u2026 but it\u2019 s\u2026Dain. \u201cDon\u2019 t look so surprised.\u201d He rolls his eyes and opens the door, carrying my pack as he helps me inside. His room is simple, with a bed, dresser , desk, and wardrobe. There\u2019 s nothing personal about it other than a few books on his desk. I note with a tiny burst of satisfaction that one is the tome on the Krovlan language that I gave him before he left last summer . He\u2019s always had a gift for languages. Even the blanke t on his bed is simple, rider black, as if he might forget why he\u2019s here while sleeping. The window is arched, and I move toward it. I can see the rest of Basgiath across the ravine through the clear glass. It\u2019s the same war college and yet an entire world away . There are two more candidates on the parapet, but I look away before I can feel invested just to watch them fall. There is only so much death one person can take in a day , and I\u2019m at my fucking maximum.",
  "\u201cDo you have wraps in here?\u201d He hands me the rucksack. \u201cGot them all from Major Gillstead,\u201d I answer with a nod, plopp ing down on the edge of his expertly made bed and starting to dig throug h my pack. Luckily for me, Mira is an infin itely better packer than I am, and the wrapsare easy to spot. \u201cMake yourself at home.\u201d He grins, leaning back against the closed door and hooking one ankle over the other . \u201cAs much as I hate that you\u2019re here, I have to say it\u2019 s more than nice to see your face, V i.\u201d I look up, and our eyes meet. The tension that\u2019s been in my chest for the last week\u2014hell, the last six months\u2014eases, and for a second, it\u2019s just us. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s exposing a weakness, but I don\u2019t care. Dain knows almost everything there is to know about me anyway .",
  "\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve missed you, too,\u201d he says quietly , his eyes softening. My chest draws tight, and there\u2019 s an awareness between us, an almost tangible sense of\u2026anticipation as he looks at me. Maybe after all these years, we\u2019re finally on the same page when it comes to wanting each other . Or maybe he\u2019 s just relieved to see an old friend. \u201cYou\u2019d better get that leg wrapp ed.\u201d He turns around to face the door. \u201cI won\u2019 t look.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019 t seen before.\u201d I arch my hips and shimmy my leather pants down past my thighs and over my knees. Shit. The one on the left is swollen. If anyone else had taken that stumble, they would have ended up with a bruise, maybe even a scrape.",
  "But me? I have to fix it so my kneecap stays where it\u2019 s supposed to. It\u2019 s not just my muscles that are weak. My ligaments that hold my joints together don\u2019 t work for shit, either . \u201cYeah, well, we\u2019re not sneaking away to swim in the river, are we?\u201d he teases. We grew up together through every post our parent s had been stationed at, and no matter where we were, we always managed to find a place to swim and trees to climb. I fasten the wrap at the top of my knee, then wind and secure the joint in the same way I\u2019ve done since I was old enough for the healers to teach me. It\u2019s a practiced motion that I could do in my sleep, and the familiarity of it is almost soothing, if it didn\u2019 t mean I was starting in the quadrant wounded. As soon as I get it fastened with the little metal clasp, I stand and tug myleathers back up over my ass and button them. \u201cAll covered.\u201d He turns and glances over me. \u201cY ou look\u2026dif ferent.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the leathers.\u201d I shrug. \u201cWh y? Is different bad?\u201d It takes a second to close my rucksack and haul it up and over my shoulders.",
  "Thank you, gods, the ache in my knee is manageable with it bound like this. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d He shakes his head slowly , teasing his lower lip with his teeth. \u201cDif ferent.\u201d \u201cWhy , Dain Aetos.\u201d I grin and walk toward him, then grasp the door handle at his side. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me in swimwear , tunics , and even ballgowns. Are you telling me it\u2019 s the leather that does it for you?\u201d He scoffs, but there\u2019s a slight flush to his cheeks as his hand covers mine to open the door. \u201cGlad to see our year apart hasn\u2019 t dulled your tongue, Vi.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I toss over my shoulder as we walk into the hallway , \u201cI can do quite a few things with my tongue. You\u2019d be impressed.\u201d My smile is so wide that it almost hurts, and just for a second, I forget that we\u2019re in the Riders Quadrant or that I\u2019ve just survived the parapet. His eyes heat. Guess he\u2019s forgotten, too. Then again, Mira\u2019 s always made it clear that riders aren\u2019 t an inhibited bunch behind these walls. There\u2019 s not much reason to deny yourself when you might not live through tomorrow .",
  "\u201cWe have to get you out of here,\u201d he says, shaking his head like he needs to clear it. Then he does the hand thing again, and I hear the lock slide into place. There\u2019 s no one in the hallway , and we make it to the stairwell quickly . \u201cThanks,\u201d I say as we start descending. \u201cMy knee feels way better now .\u201d \u201cI still can\u2019t believe your mother thought putting you into the Riders Quadrant was a good idea.\u201d I can practically feel the anger vibrating of f him next to me as we walk down the stairs.",
  "There\u2019 s no banister on his side, but he doesn\u2019 t seem to mind, even though a single misstep would be the end of him. \u201cMe neither . She announced her decree about which quadrant I\u2019d chooselast spring, after I passed the initial entrance exam, and I immediately started working with Major Gillstead.\u201d He\u2019ll be so proud when he reads the rolls tomorrow and sees that I\u2019m not on them. \u201cThere\u2019 s a door at the bottom of this stairwell, below the main level, that leads to the passage into the Healers Quadrant farther up the ravine,\u201d he says as we approach the first floor. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you through that and into the Scribe Quadrant.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I stop as my feet hit the polished stone landing at the main floor , but he continues downward. He\u2019s already three steps beneath me when he realizes I\u2019m not with him. \u201cThe Scribe Quadrant,\u201d he says slowly , turning to face me. This angle makes me taller than he is, and I glare down at him. \u201cI can\u2019t go to the Scribe Quadrant, Dain.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d His eyebrows fly up. \u201cShe won\u2019 t stand for it.\u201d I shake my head. His mouth opens, then shuts, and his fists clench at his sides. \u201cThis place will kill you, Violet. You can\u2019t stay here.",
  "Everyone will understand. You didn\u2019 t volunteer\u2014not really .\u201d Anger bristles up my spine, and my gaze narrows on him. Ignoring who did or did not volunteer me, I snap, \u201cOne, I\u2019m well aware of what my chances are here, Dain , and two, usually fifteen percent of candidates don\u2019t make it past the parapet, and I\u2019m still standing, so I guess I\u2019m beating those odds already .\u201d He backs up another step. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you didn\u2019 t just kick absolute ass by getting here, Vi. But you have to leave. You\u2019ll break the first time they put you in the sparring ring, and that\u2019s befor e the dragons sense that you\u2019re\u2026\u201d He shakes his head and looks away , his jaw clenching. \u201cI\u2019m what ?\u201d My hackles rise. \u201cGo ahead and say it. When they sense I\u2019m less than the others? Is that what you mean?\u201d \u201cDamn it.\u201d He rakes his hand over his close-cropped light-bro wn curls.\u201cStop putting words in my mouth. You know what I mean. Even if you survive to Threshing, there\u2019 s no guarantee a dragon will bond you.",
  "As it was, last year we had thirty-four unbonded cadets who have just been sitting around, waiting to restart the year with this class to get a chance at bonding again, and they\u2019re all perfectly healthy\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t be an asshole.\u201d My stomach falls.",
  "Just because he might be right doesn\u2019 t mean I want to hear it\u2026or want to be called unhealthy . \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep you alive!\u201d he shouts, his voice echoing off the stone of the stairwell. \u201cIf we get you to the Scribe Quadrant right now, you can still ace their test and have a phenomenal story to tell when you\u2019re out drinking. I take you back out there\u201d\u2014he points to the doorway that leads to the courtyard\u2014\u201cit\u2019 s out of my hands. I can\u2019 t protect you here. Not fully .\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to!\u201d Wait\u2026 didn\u2019 t I want him to? Wasn\u2019t that what Mira suggested? \u201cWhy would you tell Rhiannon to put me in your squad if you just wanted to sneak me out the back door?\u201d The vise around my chest squeezes tighter . Next to Mira, Dain is the person who knows me best on the entire damned Continent, and even he thinks I can\u2019 t hack it here. \u201cTo make her leave so I could get you out!\u201d He climbs two steps, shortening the distance between us, but there\u2019 s no give in the set of his shoulders. If determination had a physical form, it would be Dain Aetos right now.",
  "\u201cDo you think I want to watch my best friend die? Do you think it\u2019ll be fun to see what they\u2019ll do to you, knowing you\u2019re General Sorrengail\u2019 s daughter?",
  "Putting on leathers doesn\u2019 t make you a rider, Vi. They\u2019re going to tear you to shreds, and if they don\u2019t, the dragons will. In the Riders Quadrant, you either graduate or die, and you know that. Let me save you.\u201d His entire posture droops, and the plea in his eyes shreds some of my indignation. \u201cPlease let me save you.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d I whisper . \u201cShe said she\u2019d haul me right back. I either leave here as a rider or as a name on a stone.\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019 t mean it.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cShe can\u2019 t mean that.\u201d \u201cShe means it. Even Mira couldn\u2019 t talk her out of it.\u201d He searches my eyes and tenses, as if he sees the truth of it there. \u201cShit.\u201d \u201cYeah. Shit.\u201d I shrug, like it\u2019 s not my life we\u2019re talking about here. \u201cAll right.\u201d I can see him mentally changing gears, adapting to the information. \u201cWe\u2019ll find another way. For now, let\u2019s go.\u201d He takes my hand and leads me to the alcove we disappeared from. \u201cGet out there and meet the other first-years. I\u2019ll go back and enter from the turret doorw ay.",
  "They\u2019ll figure out we know each other soon enough, but don\u2019t give anyone ammunition.\u201d He squeezes my hand and lets go, walking away without another word and disappearing into the tunnel. I grip the straps of my rucksack and walk into the dappled sunlight of the courtyard. The clouds are breaking, and the drizzle is burning off as the gravel crunches beneath my feet on my way toward the riders and cadets. The massive courtyard, which could easily fit a thousand riders, is just like the map in the archives recorded. Shaped like an angular teardrop, the rounded end is formed by a giant outer wall at least ten feet thick. Along the sides are stone halls. I know the four-story building carved into the mountain with the rounded end is for academics, and the one on the right, towering over the cliff, is the dorms, where Dain took me. The imposing rotunda linking the two buildings also serves as the entra nce to the gathering hall, commons, and library behind it. I quit gawking and turn in the courtyard to face the outer wall. There\u2019 s a stone dais on the right side of the parapet, occupied by two uniformed men I recognize as the commandant and executive commandant, both in full military dress, their medals winking in the sunlight.",
  "It takes me a few minutes to find Rhiannon in the growing crowd, talking to another girl whose jet-black hair is cut just as short as Dain\u2019 s. \u201cThere you are!\u201d Rhiannon\u2019 s smile is genuine and full of relief. \u201cI was worried. Is everything\u2026\u201d She lifts her eyebrows.\u201cI\u2019m good to go.\u201d I nod and turn toward the other woman as Rhiannon introduces us. Her name is Tara, and she\u2019s from the Morraine province to the north, along the coast of the Emerald Sea. She has that same air of confidence Mira does, and her eyes dance with excitement as she and Rhiannon talk about how they\u2019ve both obsessed over dragons since childhood. I pay attention but only enough to recall details if we need to form an alliance.",
  "An hour passes, then another , according to the Basgiath bells, which we can hear from here. Then the last of the cadets walks into the courtyard, followed by the three riders from the other turret. Xaden is among them. It\u2019s not just his height that makes him stand out in this crowd but the way the other riders all seem to move around him, like he\u2019s a shark and they\u2019re all fish giving him a wide berth. For a second, I can\u2019t help but wonder what his signet is, the unique power from the bond with his dragon, and if that\u2019s why even the third-years seem to scurry out of his way as he strides up to the dais with lethal grace. There are ten of them in total up there now, and from the way Commandant Panchek moves to the front, facing us\u2014 \u201cI think we\u2019re about to start,\u201d I say to Rhiannon and Tara, and they both turn to face the dais.",
  "Everyone does. \u201cThree hundred and one of you have survived the parapet to become cadets today ,\u201d Commandant Panchek starts with a politician\u2019 s smile, gesturing to us. The guy has always talked with his hands. \u201cGood job. Sixty-seven did not.\u201d My chest clenches as my brain spins the calculation quickly . Almost twenty percent. Was it the rain? The wind? That\u2019 s more than average. Sixty- seven people died trying to get here. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this position is just a stepping stone for him,\u201d Tara whispers. \u201cHe wants Sorrengail\u2019 s job, then General Melgren\u2019 s.\u201d The commandin g general of all Navarre\u2019 s forces. Melgren\u2019 s beady eyeshave always made me shrivel every time we\u2019ve met during my mother \u2019s career .",
  "\u201cGeneral Melgren\u2019 s?\u201d Rhiannon whispers from my other side. \u201cHe\u2019ll never get it,\u201d I say quietly as the commandant welcomes us to the Riders Quadran t. \u201cMelgren\u2019 s dragon gives him the signet ability to see a battle\u2019 s outcome before it happens. There\u2019 s no beating that, and you can\u2019 t be assassinated if you know it\u2019 s coming.\u201d \u201cAs the Codex says, now you begin the true crucible!\u201d Panchek shouts, his voice carrying over the five hundred of us that I estimate are in this courtyard. \u201cYou will be tested by your superiors, hunted by your peers, and guided by your instincts. If you survive to Threshing, and if you are chosen, you will be riders. Then we\u2019ll see how many of you make it to graduation.\u201d Statistics say about a quarter of us will live to graduate, give or take a few on any year, and yet the Riders Quadrant is never short volun teers. Every cadet in this courtyard thinks they have what it takes to be one of the elite, the very best Navarre has to offer\u2026a dragon rider. I can\u2019t help but wonder for the smallest of seconds if maybe I do, too. Maybe I can do more than just survive.",
  "\u201cYour instructors will teach you,\u201d Panchek promises, his hand sweeping to the line of professors standing at the doors to the academic wing. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you how well you learn.\u201d He swings his pointer finger at us. \u201cDiscipline falls to your units, and your wingleader is the last word. If I have to get involved\u2026\u201d A slow, sinister smile spreads across his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me involved. \u201cWith that said, I\u2019ll leave you to your wingleaders. My best advice?",
  "Don\u2019 t die.\u201d He walks off the dais with the executive command ant, leaving only the riders on the stone stage. A brunette woman with wide shoulders and a scarred sneer stalks forward, the silver spikes on the shoulders of her uniform flashing in the sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m Nyra, the senior wingleader of the quadrant and the head ofthe First W ing. Section leaders and squad leaders, take your positions now .\u201d My shou lder is jostled as someo ne walks by, pushing between Rhiannon and me. Others follow suit until there are about fifty people in front of us, spaced out in formation. \u201cSections and squads,\u201d I whispe r to Rhiannon, in case she didn\u2019 t grow up in a military family . \u201cThree squads in each section and three sections in each of the four wings.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d Rhiannon answers. Dain stands in the section for Second Wing, facing me but averting his eyes. \u201cFirst Squad! Claw Section! First W ing!\u201d Nyra calls out. A man closer to the dais raises his hand.",
  "\u201cCadets, when your name is called, take up formation behind your squad leader ,\u201d Nyra instructs. The redhead with the crossbow and roll steps forward and begins calling names. One by one, cadets move from the crowd to the formation, and I keep count, making snap judgm ents based off clothing and arrogance. It looks like each squad will have about fifteen or sixteen people in it. Jack is called into the Flame Section of First W ing. Tara is called into the T ail Section, and soon they start on Second W ing. I let loose a thankful sigh when the wingleader steps forward and it isn\u2019t Xaden. Rhiannon and I are both called to Second Squad, Flame Sectio n, Second Wing. We get into formation quickly , lining up in a square. A quick glance tells me that we have a squad leader\u2014Dain, who isn\u2019t lookin g at me\u2014a female executiv e squad leader , four riders who look like they might be second- or third-years, and nine first-years. One of the riders with two stars on her uniform and half-shave d, half-pink hair has a rebellion relic that winds around her forearm, from her wrist to above her elbow , where it disappears unde r her uniform, but I look away so she won\u2019t catch mestaring. We\u2019re silent as the rest of the wings are called.",
  "The sun is out in full now, beating into my leathers and scorching my skin.",
  "I told him not to keep you in that library .",
  "Mom\u2019 s words from this morning haunt me, but it\u2019s not like I could have prepared for this. I have exactly two shades when it comes to the sun, pale and burned. When the order sounds, we all turn to face the dais. I try to keep my gaze on the roll-keep er, but my eyes jerk right like the traitors they are, and my pulse leaps. Xaden watches me with a cold, calculating look that feels like he\u2019s plotting my death from where he stands as the wingleader for Fourth W ing. I lift my chin. He cocks his scarred eyebrow . Then he says something to Secon d Wing\u2019s wingleader , and then every wingleader joins in on what\u2019 s obviously a heated discussion. \u201cWhat do you think they\u2019re talking about?\u201d Rhiannon whispers. \u201cQuiet,\u201d Dain hisses. My spine stiffens. I can\u2019t expect him to be my Dain here, not under these circumstances, but still, the tone is jarring. Finally , the wingleaders turn around to face us, and the slight tilt to Xaden\u2019 s lips makes me instantly queasy . \u201cDain Aetos, you and your squad will switch with Aura Bein haven\u2019 s,\u201d Nyra orders. Wait. What? Who is Aura Beinhaven?",
  "Dain nods, then turns to us. \u201cFollow me.\u201d He says it once, then strides through formatio n, leaving us to scurry after him. We pass another squad on the way from\u2026from\u2026 The very breath freezes in my lungs. We\u2019re moving to Fourth W ing. Xaden\u2019 s wing. It takes a minute, maybe two, and we take our place in the new formation.I force myself to breathe. There\u2019 s a fucking smirk on Xaden\u2019 s arrogant, handsome face. I\u2019m now entirely at his mercy , a subordinate in his chain of command. He can punish me however he likes for the slightest infraction, even imaginary ones. Nyra looks at Xaden as she finishes assignments, and he nods, stepping forward and finally breaking our staring contest. I\u2019m pretty sure he won, considering my heart is galloping like a runaway horse. \u201cYou\u2019re all cadets now.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s voice carries out over the courtyard, stronger than the others. \u201cTake a look at your squad. These are the only people guaranteed by Codex not to kill you. But just because they can\u2019t end your life doesn\u2019 t mean others won\u2019 t. You want a dragon? Earn one.\u201d Most of the others cheer , but I keep my mouth shut.",
  "Sixty-seven people fell or died in some other way today . Sixty-seven just like Dylan, whose parents woul d either collect their bodies or watch them be burie d at the foot of the mountain under a simple stone. I can\u2019t force myself to cheer for their loss. Xaden\u2019 s eyes find mine, and my stomach clenches before he looks away . \u201cAnd I bet you feel pretty badass right now , don\u2019 t you, first-years?\u201d More cheers. \u201cYou feel invincible after the parapet, don\u2019t you?\u201d Xaden shouts. \u201cYou think you\u2019re untouchable! You\u2019re on the way to becoming the elite! The few! The chosen!\u201d Another round of cheers goes up with each declaration, louder and louder .",
  "No. That\u2019 s not just cheering, it\u2019s the sound of wings beating the air into submission. \u201cOh gods, they\u2019r e beautiful,\u201d Rhiannon whispers at my side as they come into view\u2014a riot of dragons. I\u2019ve spent my life around dragons, but always from a distan ce. They don\u2019t tolerate humans they haven\u2019 t chosen. But these eight? They\u2019re flyingstraight for us\u2014at speed. Just when I think they\u2019re about to fly overhead, they pitch vertically , whip the air with their huge semitranslucent wings, and stop, the gusts of wing-made wind so powerful that I nearly stagger backward as they land on the outer semicircular wall. Their chest scales ripple with movement, and their razor -sharp talons dig into the edge of the wall on either side. Now I understand why the walls are ten feet thick. It\u2019s not a barrier . The edge of the fortress is a damned perch. My mouth drops open. In my five years of living here, I\u2019ve never seen this, but then again, I\u2019ve never been allowed to watch what happens on Conscription Day . A few cadets scream. Guess everyone wants to be a dragon rider until they\u2019re actually twenty feet away from one.",
  "Steam blasts my face as the navy-blue one directly in front of me exhales through its wide nostrils. Its glistening blue horns rise above its head in an elegant, lethal sweep, and its wings flare momentarily before tucking in, the tip of their top joint crowned by a single fierce talon. Their tails are just as fatal, but I can\u2019t see them at this angle or even tell which breed of dragon each is without that clue. All are deadly . \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to bring the masons in again,\u201d Dain mutters as chunks of rock crumble under the dragons\u2019 grips, crashing to the courtyard in boulders the size of my torso. There are three dragons in various shades of red, two shades of green\u2014 like Teine, Mira\u2019 s dragon\u2014one brown like Mom\u2019 s, one orange, and the enormous navy one ahead of me. They\u2019re all massive, overshadowing the structure of the citadel as they narrow their golden eyes at us in absolute judgment. If they didn\u2019 t need us puny humans to develop signet abilities frombonding and weave the protecti ve wards they power around Navarre, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019 d eat us all and be done. But they like protecting the Vale\u2014 the valley behind Basgiath the dragons call home\u2014from merciless gryphons and we like living, so here we are in the most unlikely of partnerships.",
  "My heart threatens to beat out of my chest, and I absolutely agree with it, because I\u2019d like to run, too. Just thinking that I\u2019m supposed to ride one of these is fucking ludicrous. A cadet bolts out of Third Wing, screaming as he makes a run for the stone keep behind us. We all turn to look as he sprints for the giant arched door at the center . I can almost see the words carved into the arch from here, but I already know them by heart. A dragon without its rider is a tragedy . A rider without their dragon is dead. Once bonded, riders can\u2019t live without their dragons, but most dragons can live just fine after us. It\u2019s why they choose carefully , so they\u2019re not humiliated by picking a cowar d, not that a dragon would ever admit to making a mistake. The red dragon on the left opens its vast mouth, revealing teeth as big as I am. That jaw could crush me if it wanted, like a grape. Fire erupts along its tongue, then shoots outward in a macabre blaze toward the fleeing cadet. He\u2019s a pile of ash on the gravel before he can even make it to the shadow of the keep. Sixty-eight dead.",
  "Heat from the flames blasts the side of my face as I jerk my attention forward. If anyone else runs and is likewise executed, I don\u2019t want to see it. More screaming sounds around me. I lock my jaw as hard as I can to keep quiet. There are two more gusts of heat, one to my left and then another to my right. Make that seventy .The navy dragon seems to tilt its head at me, as if its narrowed golden eyes can see straight through me to the fear fisting my stomach and the doubt curled insidiously around my heart. I bet it can even see the wrap binding my knee. It knows I\u2019m at a disadvantage, that I\u2019m too small to climb its foreleg and mount, too frail to ride. Dragons always know . But I will not run. I wouldn\u2019 t be standing here if I\u2019d quit every time something seemed impossible to overcome. I will not die today . The words repeat in my head just like they had before the parapet and on it. I force my shoulders back and lift my chin. The dragon blinks, which might be a sign of approval, or boredom, and looks away . \u201cAnyone else feel like changing their mind?\u201d Xaden shouts, scanning the remaining rows of cadets with the same shrewd gaze of the navy-blue dragon behind him. \u201cNo? Excellent.",
  "Roughly half of you will be dead by this time next summer .\u201d The formation is silent except for a few untimely sobs from my left. \u201cA third of you again the year after that, and the same your last year. No one cares who your mommy or daddy is here. Even King Tauri\u2019s second son died during his Threshing. So tell me again: Do you feel invincible now that you\u2019ve made it into the Riders Quadrant? Untouchable? Elite?\u201d No one cheers. Another blast of heat rushes\u2014t his time directly at my face\u2014a nd every muscle in my body clenches, preparing for incineration. But it\u2019s not flames\u2026just steam, and it blows back Rhiannon\u2019 s braids as the dragons finish their simu ltaneous exhale . The breeches on the first-year ahead of me darken, the color spreading down his legs.",
  "They want us scared. Mission accomplished. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not untouchable or special to them.\u201d Xaden points toward the navy dragon and leans forward slightly , like he\u2019s letting us in on a secret as we lock eyes. \u201cT o them, you\u2019re just the prey .\u201dThe sparring ring is wher e riders ar e made or br oken. After all, no respectable dragon would choose a rider who cannot defend themselves, and no r espectable cadet would allow such a thr eat to the wing to continue training. \u2014M AJOR AFENDRA \u2019S GUIDE TO THE RIDERS QUADRANT (UNAUTHORIZED EDITION ) CHAPTER FOUR \u201cElena Sosa, Brayden Blackburn.\u201d Captain Fitzgibbons reads from the death roll, flank ed by two other scribes on the dais as we stand in silent formation in the courtyard, squinting into the early sun. This morning, we\u2019re all in rider black, and there\u2019 s a single silver four- pointed star on my collarbone, the mark of a first-year , and a Fourth Wing patch on my shoulder .",
  "We were issued standard uniforms yesterday , summer -weight tight-fitted tunics, pants, and accessories after Parapet was over, but not flight leathers. There\u2019 s no point handing out the thicker , more protective comb at uniforms when half of us won\u2019 t be around come Threshing in October . The armored corset Mira made me isn\u2019t regulation, but I fit right in among the hundreds of modified uniforms around me. After the last twenty-four hours and one night in the first-floor barracks, I\u2019m starting to realize that this quadrant is a strange mix of we-might-die- tomorrow hedonism and brutal ef ficiency in the name of the same reason. \u201cJace Sutherland.\u201d Captain Fitzg ibbons continues to read, and the scribes next to him shift their weight. \u201cDougal Luperco.\u201d I think we\u2019re somewhere in the fifties, but I lost count when he read Dylan\u2019 s name a few minutes ago. This is the only memorial the names willget, the only time they\u2019ll be spoken of in the citadel, so I try to concentrate, to commit each name to memory , but there\u2019 s just too many .",
  "My skin is agitated from wearing the armor all night like Mira suggested, and my knee aches, but I resist the urge to bend down and adjust the wrap I managed to put on in the nonex istent privacy of my bunk in the first-year barracks before anyone else woke up. There are a hundred and fifty-six of us in the first floor of the dormitory building, our beds positioned in four neat rows in the open space. Even though Jack Barlowe was put in the third-floor dorms, I\u2019m not about to let any of them see my weaknesses. Not until I know who I can trust. Private rooms are like flight leathers\u2014you don\u2019t get one until you survive Threshing. \u201cSimone Casteneda.\u201d Captain Fitzgibbons closes the scroll. \u201cWe commend their souls to Malek.\u201d The god of death.",
  "I blink. Guess we were closer to the end than I thought. There\u2019 s no formal conclusion to the formation, no last moment of silence. The names on the scroll leave the dais with the scribes, and the quiet is broken as the squad leaders all turn and begin to address their squads. \u201cHopefully you all ate breakfast , because you\u2019re not going to get another chance before lunch,\u201d Dain says, his eyes meeting mine for the span of a heartbeat before he glances away , feigning indif ference. \u201cHe\u2019 s good at pretending he doesn\u2019t know you,\u201d Rhiannon whispers at my side. \u201cHe is,\u201d I reply just as softly . A smile tugs at the corners of my mouth, but I keep my expression as bland as possible as I soak in the sight of him. The sun plays in his sandy-brown hair, and when he turns his head, I see a scar peeking from his beard along his chin I\u2019d somehow missed yesterday . \u201cSecond- and third-years, I\u2019m assuming you know where to go,\u201d Dain continues as the scribes wind their way around the edge of the courtyard to my right, headed back to their quadrant. I ignore the tiny voice inside meprotesting that it was supposed to be my quadrant. Lingering on what could have been isn\u2019 t going to help me survive to see tomorrow\u2019 s sunrise.",
  "There\u2019 s a mutter of agreement from the senior cadets ahead of us. As first-years, we\u2019re in the back two rows of the little square that makes up Second Squad. \u201cFirst-years, at least one of you should have memorized your academic schedule when it was handed out yesterday .\u201d Dain\u2019 s voice booms over us, and it\u2019s hard to reconcile this stern-faced, serious leader with the funny , grinning guy I\u2019ve always know n. \u201cStick together . I expect you all to be alive when we meet this afternoon in the sparring gym.\u201d Fuck, I\u2019d almost forgotten that we\u2019re sparring today . We only have the gym twice a week, so as long as I can get through today\u2019s session unscathed, I\u2019m in the clear for another couple of days. At least I have some time to get my feet under me before we\u2019ll have to handle the Gauntlet\u2014the terrifying vertical obstacle course they told us we\u2019ll have to master when the leaves turn colors in two months. If we can compl ete the final Gauntlet, we\u2019ll walk through the natural box canyon above it that leads to the flight field for Presentation, where this year\u2019s dragons willing to bond will get their first look at the remaining cadets. Two days after that, Threshing will occur in the valley beneath the citadel.",
  "I glance around at my new squadmates and can\u2019t help but wond er which of us, if any , will make it to that flight field, let alone that valley . Don\u2019 t borr ow tomorr ow\u2019s trouble. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re not?\u201d the smart-ass first-year behind me asks. I don\u2019t bother looking, but Rhiannon does, rolling her eyes as she turns back forward. \u201cThen I won\u2019 t have to be concer ned with learning your name, since it will be read of f tomorrow morning,\u201d Dain answers with a shrug. A second-year ahead of me snorts a laugh, the movement jangling twosmall hoop earrings in her left lobe, but the pink-haired one stays silent. \u201cSawyer?\u201d Dain looks at the first-year to my left. \u201cI\u2019ll get them there.\u201d The tall, wiry cadet whose light comp lexion is covered with a smattering of freckles answers with a tight nod. His freckled jaw ticks, and my chest pangs with sympathy .",
  "He\u2019s one of the repeats\u2014a cadet who didn\u2019 t bond during Threshing and now has to start the entire year over. \u201cGet going,\u201d Dain orders, and our squad breaks apart around the same time the others do, transforming the courtyard from an orderly formation to a crowd of chatting cadets. The second- and third-years walk off in another direction, including Dain. \u201cWe have about twenty minutes to get to class,\u201d Sawyer shouts at the eight of us first-years. \u201cFourt h floor , second room on the left in the academic wing. Get your shit and don\u2019t be late.\u201d He doesn\u2019 t bother waiting to confirm we\u2019ve heard him before he heads of f toward the dormitory . \u201cThat has to be hard,\u201d Rhiannon says as we follow the crowd toward the dorms. \u201cBeing set back and having to do this all over again.\u201d \u201cBetter than being dead,\u201d the smart-ass says as he passes us on the right, his dark-brown hair flopping against the brown skin of his forehead with every step the shorter cadet takes. His name is Ridoc, if I remember correctly from the brief introductions we went through before dinner last night. \u201cThat\u2019 s true,\u201d I reply as we head into the bottleneck that\u2019s formed at the door. \u201c I overh eard a third-year say when a first-year",
  "survives Threshing unbonded , the quadrant lets them repeat the year and try again if they want , \u201d Rhianno n adds , and I can \u2019 t help but wonder how much determination it would take to survive your first year and then be willing to repeat it just for the chance you might one day become a rider . You could just as easily die the second time around.A bird whistles to the left, and I look over the crowd, my heart leaping because I immediately recognize the tone. Dain.",
  "The call sounds again, and I narrow it down to somewhere near the door to the rotunda. He\u2019s standing at the top of the wide staircase, and the second our eyes lock, he motions toward the door with a subtle nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be\u2014 \u201d I start saying to Rhia nnon, but she\u2019s already followed my line of sight. \u201cI\u2019ll grab your stuff and meet you there. It\u2019s under your bunk, right?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou don\u2019 t mind?\u201d \u201cYour bunk is next to mine, Violet. It\u2019s not a hassle. Go!\u201d She gives me a conspiratorial smile and shoulder bumps me. \u201cThank you!\u201d I smile quickly , then wade across the crowd until I break free at the edge. Lucky for me, there aren\u2019 t many cadets headed into commons, which means there aren\u2019 t any eyes on me once I slip inside one of the four giant doors of the rotunda. My lungs pull in a sharp breath.",
  "It looks like the renderings I\u2019ve seen in the Archives, but there is no drawing, no artistic medium, that can capture just how overwhelming the space is, how exquisite every detail. The rotunda might be the most beautiful piece of architecture not only in the citadel but in all of Basgiath. The room is three stories tall, from its polished marble floors to the domed glass ceiling that filters in the soft morning light. To the left are two massive arched doors to the academic wing, echoed by the same on the right, leading to the dorms, and up a half dozen steps, there are four doorways in front of me that open into the gathering hall. Equally spaced around the rotunda, shimmering in their various colors of red, green, brown, orange, blue, and black, stand six daunting marble pillars carved into dragons, as if they\u2019d come crashing down from the ceiling above. There\u2019 s enough room between the snarling mouths at the base ofeach to fit at least four squads in the center , but it\u2019 s empty right now . I pass by the first dragon, chiseled from dark-red marble, and a hand grips my elbow, pulling me back behind the pillar where there\u2019 s a gap between the claw and the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201d Dain\u2019s voice is low and quiet as he turns me to face him.",
  "Tension radiates from every line of his frame. \u201cI figure d, since you were the one birdcalling me.\u201d I grin, shaking my head. He\u2019s been using that signal since we were kids living near the Krovlan border while our parents were stationed there with the Southern Wing. His brow furrows as his gaze scans over me, no doubt looking for new injuries. \u201cWe only have a few minutes before this place is packed.",
  "How is your knee?\u201d \u201cIt hurts , but I\u2019ll live.\u201d I\u2019ve had far worse injuries and we both know it, but there\u2019 s no use telling him to relax when he\u2019 s obviously not going to. \u201cNo one tried to screw with you last night?\u201d Concern creases his forehead, and I fold my arms to keep from smoothing the lines with my fingers. His worry sits on my chest like a stone. \u201cWould it be so bad if they did?\u201d I tease, forcing my smile to widen. He drops his arms to his sides and sighs so hard, the sound echoes in the rotunda. \u201cY ou know that\u2019 s not what I mean, V iolet.\u201d \u201cNo one tried to kill me last night, Dain, or even hurt me.\u201d I lean back against the wall and take some weight off my knee. \u201cPretty sure we were all too tired and relieved to be alive to start slaughtering one another .\u201d The barracks fell quiet pretty quickly after lights out. There was something to be said for the emotional exhaustion of the day . \u201cAnd you ate, right? I know they usher you out of the dorms fast when the bells chime for six.\u201d \u201cI ate with the rest of the first-years, and before you even think about lecturing me, I rewrapped my knee under my covers and had my hairbraided before the bells sounded .",
  "I\u2019ve been keeping scribe hours for years , Dain. They\u2019re up an hour earlier . It makes me want to volunteer for breakfast duty , actually .\u201d He glances at the tight, silver -tipped braid I\u2019ve pinned into a bun against the darker hair near the crown of my head. \u201cY ou should cut it.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t start with me.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cThere\u2019 s a reason women keep it short here, Vi. The second someone gets ahold of your hair in the sparring ring\u2014\u201d \u201cMy hair is the least of my concerns in the sparring ring,\u201d I retort. His eyes widen. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep you safe. You\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019 t shove you into Captain Fitzgib bons\u2019 s hands this morning and beg him to take you out of here.\u201d I ignore the bluster of a threat. We\u2019re wasting time, and there\u2019 s one piece of information I need from Dain. \u201cWhy was our squad moved from Second Wing to Fourth yesterday?\u201d He stif fens and looks away . \u201cTell me.\u201d I need to know if I\u2019m reading into a situation that doesn\u2019 t exist. \u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters, ripping his hand over his hair. \u201cXaden Riorson wants you dead. It\u2019s common knowledge among the leadership cadre after yesterday .\u201d Nope.",
  "Not overreacting. \u201cHe moved the squad so he has a direct line to me. So he can do whatever he wants and no one will question a thing. I\u2019m his revenge against my mother .\u201d My heart doesn\u2019 t even jump at the confirmation of what I already knew . \u201cThat\u2019 s what I thought. I just needed to be sure my imagination wasn\u2019 t running away with me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you.\u201d Dain steps forward and cups my face, his thumb stroking over my cheekbone in a soothing motion. \u201cThere\u2019 s not much you can do.\u201d I push off the wall, stepping out of hisreach. \u201cI have to get to class.\u201d Already , there are a few voices echoing in the rotunda as cadets pass through. His jaw works for a second, and the lines are back between his eyebrows. \u201cJust do your best to keep a low profile, especially when we\u2019re in Battle Brief. Not like the colors in your hair don\u2019t give you away , but that\u2019s the one class the entire quadrant takes. I\u2019ll see if one of the secon d-years can stand guard\u2014\u201d \u201cNo one is going to assassinate me during history .\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cAcademics are the one place I don\u2019t have to worry .",
  "What is Xaden going to do? Pull me out of class and run me through with a sword in the middle of the hallway? Or do you honestly think he\u2019ll stab me in the middle of Battle Brief?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019 t put it past him. He\u2019s fucking ruthless , Violet. Why do you think his dragon chose him?\u201d \u201cThe navy-blue one who landed behind the dais yesterday?\u201d My stomach twists. The way those golden eyes assessed me\u2026 Dain nods. \u201cSgaeyl is a Blue Daggertail, and she\u2019s\u2026vicious.\u201d He swallows. \u201cDon \u2019t get me wrong. Cath is a nasty piece of work when he gets riled\u2014all Red Swordtails are\u2014but even most dragons steer clear of Sgaeyl.\u201d I stare at Dain, at the scar that defines his jaw and the hard set of his eyes that are familiar and yet not. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks.",
  "The voices around us grow louder , and there are more footsteps coming and going. \u201cYou bonded a dragon. You have powers I don\u2019t even know about. You open doors with magic. You\u2019re a squad leader .\u201d I say the senten ces slowly , hoping they\u2019ll sink in, that I\u2019ll truly grasp how much he\u2019s chang ed. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to wrap my head around you still being\u2026Dain.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still me.\u201d His posture softens, and he lifts the short sleeve of his tunic, revealing the relic of a red dragon on his shoulder . \u201cI just have thisnow. And as for the powers, Cath channels a pretty significant amount of magic compared to some of the other dragons, but I\u2019m nowhere near adept at it yet. I haven\u2019 t changed that much.",
  "As for lesser magic powered through the bond of my relic , I can do the typical stuff like open doors , crank up my speed , and power ink pens instead of using those inconvenient quills. \u201d \u201c What \u2019 s your signet power ? \u201d Every rider can do lesser magic once their dragon begins channeling power to them , but the signet is the unique ability that stands out , the strongest skill that results from each unique bond between dragon and rider . Some riders have the same signets. Fire wielding, ice wielding, and water wielding are just a few of the most common signet powers, all useful in battle. Then there are the signets that make a rider extraordinary . My mother can wield the power of storms. Melgren can see the outcome of battles.",
  "I can\u2019t help but wonder again what Xaden\u2019 s signet is\u2014and if he\u2019ll use it to kill me when I least expect it. \u201cI can read a person\u2019 s recent memories,\u201d Dain admits quietly . \u201cNot like an inntinnsic reads minds or anything\u2014I have to put my hands on the person, so I\u2019m not a security risk. But my signet\u2019 s not common knowledge. I think they\u2019ll use me in intelligence.\u201d He points to the compass patch beneath his Fourth Wing one on his shoulder . Wearing that sigil indicates that a signet is too classified. I just didn\u2019 t notice it yesterday . \u201cNo way.\u201d I smile, taking a calming breath as I remember Xaden\u2019 s uniform didn\u2019 t have any patches on it. He nods, an excited smile shaping his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m still learning, and of course I\u2019m better at it the closer I am to Cath, but yeah.",
  "I just put my hands on someone\u2019 s temples, and I can see what they saw . It\u2019s\u2026incredible.\u201d That signet will more than set Dain apart. It will make him one of the most valuable interrogation tools we have. \u201cAnd you say you haven\u2019 tchanged,\u201d I half tease. \u201cThis place can warp almost everything about a person, Vi. It cuts away the bullshit and the niceties, revealing whoever you are at your core. They want it that way. They want it to sever your previous bonds so your loyalty is to your wing. It\u2019s one of the many reasons that first-years aren\u2019 t allowed to correspond with their family and friends, otherwise you know I would have written you. But a year doesn\u2019t change that I still think of you as my best friend. I\u2019m still Dain, and this time next year, you will still be Violet. We will still be us.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m still alive,\u201d I joke as the bells ring. \u201cI have to get to class.\u201d \u201cYeah, and I\u2019m going to be late to the flight field.\u201d He motions toward the edge of the pillar. \u201cLook, Riorson is still a wingleader . He\u2019ll be after you, but he\u2019ll find a way to do it within the rules of the Codex, at least when people are watching. I was\u2026\u201d His cheeks flush.",
  "\u201cReally good friends with Amber Mavis\u2014the current wingleader for Third Wing\u2014last year, and I\u2019m telling you, the Codex is sacred to them. Now , you go first. I\u2019ll see you in the sparring gym.\u201d He smiles reassuringly . \u201cI\u2019ll see you.\u201d I smile back and turn on my heel, walking around the base of the massive pillar into the semi-crowded rotunda. There\u2019re a couple dozen cadets in here, walking from one building to another , and it takes a second to get my bearings. I spot the acade mic doors between the orange-and-black pillars and start that way , blending into the crowd. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up and a chill races down my spine as I cross the center of the rotunda, then my steps halt. Cadets move around me, but my eyes are drawn upward, toward the top of the steps that lead to the gathering hall. Oh shit. Xaden Riorson is watching me with narrowed eyes, the sleeves of his uniform rolled up his massive arms that remain folded across his chest, thewarning in his relic-covered arm on full display as a third-year next to him says something that he blatantly ignores.",
  "My heart jumps and lodges in my throat. There\u2019 s maybe twenty feet between us. My fingers twitch, ready to grab one of the blades sheathed at my ribs. Is this where he\u2019ll do it? In the middle of the rotunda? The marble floor is gray , so it shouldn\u2019 t be that hard for the staf f to get the blood out. His head tilts, and he studies me with those impossibly dark eyes, like he\u2019s deciding where I\u2019m most vulnerable. I should run, right? But at least I can see him coming if I hold this position. His attention shifts, glancing to my right, and he lifts a single brow at me. My stomach pitches as Dain emer ges from behind the pillar . \u201cWhat are you\u2014 \u201d Dain starts as he reaches me, his brow furrowed in confusion.",
  "\u201cTop of the steps. Fourth door ,\u201d I hiss, interrupting him. Dain\u2019 s gaze snaps up as the crowd thins out around us, and he mutters a curse, not-so-su btly stepping closer to me. Fewer people mean fewer witnesses, but I\u2019m not foolish enough to think Xaden won\u2019 t kill me in front of the whole quadrant if he wants. \u201cI alread y knew your parents are tight,\u201d Xaden calls out, a cruel smile tilting his lips. \u201cBut do you two have to be so fucking obvious?\u201d The few cadets who are still in the rotunda turn to look at us. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d Xaden continues, glancing between Dain and me. \u201cChildhood friends? First loves, even?\u201d \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you without cause, right?\u201d I whisper . \u201cWithout cause and calling a quorum of wingleaders because you\u2019re a squad leader . Article Four, Section Three.\u201d \u201cCorrect,\u201d Dain answers, not bothering to lower his voice. \u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d \u201cI expec ted you to do a better job of hiding where your affections lie,Aetos.\u201d Xaden moves, walking down the steps. Shit. Shit. Shit.",
  "\u201cRun, V iolet,\u201d Dain orders me. \u201cNow .\u201d I bolt.Knowing I am in dir ect disagr eement with General Melgr en\u2019s orders, I am officially objecting to the plan set forth in today\u2019 s briefing. It is not this general\u2019 s opinion that the childr en of the rebellion\u2019 s leaders should be for ced to witness their par ents\u2019 executions. No child should watch their par ent put to death.",
  "\u2014T HE TYRRISH REBELLION , AN OFFICIAL BRIEF FOR KING TAURI BY GENERAL LILITH SORRENGAIL CHAPTER FIVE \u201c Welcome to your first Battle Brief , \u201d Professor Devera says from the recessed floor of the enormous lecture hall later in the morning , a bright purple Flame Section patch on her shoulder matching her short hair perfectly . This is the only class held in the circular , tiered room that curves the entire end of the academic hall and one of only two rooms in the citadel capable of fitting every cadet. Every creaky wooden seat is full, and the senior third-years are standing against the walls behind us, but we all fit. It\u2019s a far cry from history last hour, where there were only three squads of first-years, but at least the first-years in our squad are all seated together . Now if I could only remember all their names. Ridoc is easy to remember\u2014he cracked wise-ass comments all through history .",
  "Hopeful ly he knows better than to try the same in here, though. Professor Devera isn\u2019 t the joking kind. \u201cIn the past, riders have seldom been called into service before graduation,\u201d Professor Devera continues, her mouth tensing as she paces slowly in front of a twenty-foot-high map of the Continent mounted to the back wall that\u2019s intricately labeled with our defensive outposts along ourborders. Dozens of mage lights illuminate the space, more than making up for the lack of windows and reflecting off the longsword she keeps strapped to her back. \u201cAnd if they were, they were always third-years who\u2019d spent time shadowing forward wings, but we expect you to graduate with the full knowledge of what we\u2019re up against. It\u2019s not about just knowing where every wing is stationed, either .\u201d She takes her time, making eye contact with every first-year she sees. The rank on her shoulder says captain, but I know she\u2019ll be a major before she leaves her rotation teaching here, given the medals pinned on her chest. \u201cYou need to understand the politics of our enemies, the strategies of defending our outposts from constant attack, and have a thorough knowledge of both recent and current battles.",
  "If you cannot grasp these basic topics, then you have no business on the back of a dragon.\u201d She arches a black brow a few shades darker than her deep-brown skin. \u201cNo pressure,\u201d Rhiannon mutters at my side, furiously taking notes. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I promise her in a whisper . \u201cThird-years have only been sent to midland posts as reinforcements, never the front.\u201d I\u2019d kept my ears open around my mother enough to know that much. \u201cThis is the only class you will have every day, because it\u2019s the only class that will matter if you\u2019re called into service early .\u201d Professor Devera\u2019 s gaze sweeps from left to right and pauses on me. Her eyes flare wide for a heartbeat, but she gives an approving smile and nod before moving on. \u201c Because this class is taught every day and relies on the most current information , you will also answer to Professor Markham , who deserves nothing but your utmost respect. \u201d She waves the scribe forward , and he moves to stand next to her , the cream color of his uniform contrasting with her stark black one .",
  "He leans in when she whispers something to him, and his thick eyebrows fly high as he whips his head in my direction.There\u2019 s no approving smile when the colonel\u2019 s weary eyes find mine, only a sigh that fills my chest with heavy sorrow when I hear it. I was supposed to be his star pupil in the Scribe Quadrant, his crowning achievement before he retires. How absolutely ironic that I\u2019m now the least likely to succeed in this one. \u201cIt is the duty of the scribes not only to study and master the past but to relay and record the present,\u201d he says, rubbing the bridge of his bulbous nose after finally tearing his disappointed gaze from mine . \u201c Without accurate depictions of our front lines , reliable information with which to make strategic decisions , and\u2014most importantly\u2014veracious details to document our history for the good of future generations , we \u2019 re doomed , not only as a kingdom but as a society . \u201d Which is exactly why I \u2019 ve always wanted to be a scribe . Not that it matters now .",
  "\u201cFirst topic of the day.\u201d Profes sor Devera moves toward the map and flicks her hand, bringing a mage light directly over the eastern border with the Poromiel province of Braevick. \u201cThe Eastern Wing experienced an attack last night near the village of Chakir by a drift of Braevi gryphons and riders.\u201d Oh shit. A murmur rips through the hall, and I dip my quill into the inkpot on the desk in front of me so I can take notes. I can\u2019t wait to channel so I can use the type of covete d pens Mom keeps on her desk. A smile curves my lips. There could definitely be perks to being a rider.",
  "There will be. \u201cNaturally , some information is redacted for security purposes, but what we can tell you is that the wards faltered along the top of the Esben Mountains.\u201d Professor Devera pulls her hands apart and the light expands, illuminating the mountains that form our border with Braevick . \u201cAllowing the drift not only to enter Navarrian territory but for their riders to channel and wield sometime around midnight.\u201dMy stom ach sinks as a murmur rises from the cadets, especially the first- years. Dragons aren\u2019 t the only animals capable of channeling powers to their riders. Gryphons from Poro miel also share the ability , but dragons are the only ones capable of poweri ng the wards that make all other magic but their own impossible within our borders. They\u2019re the reason Navarre\u2019 s borders are somewhat circular\u2014 their power radiates from the Vale and can only extend so far, even with squads stationed at every outpost. Without those wards, we\u2019re fucked. It would be open season on Navarrian villages when the raiding parties from Poromiel inevitably descend. Those greedy assholes are never content with the resources they have. They always want ours, too, and until they learn to be content with our trade agreements, we have no chance of ending conscription in Navarre. No chance of experiencing peace.",
  "But if we\u2019re not on high alert, then they must have gotten the wards rewoven, or at least stabilized. \u201cThirty-seven civilians were killed in the attack in the hour before a squad from the Eastern Wing could arrive, but the riders and dragons managed to repel the drift,\u201d Professor Devera finishes, folding her arms over her chest. \u201cBased on that information, what questions woul d you ask?\u201d She holds up a finger . \u201cI only want answers from first-years to start.\u201d My initial question would be why the hell the wards faltered, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to answer a question like that in a room full of cadets with zero security clearance. I study the map. The Esben Mountain Range is the highest along our eastern border with Braevick , making it the least likely place for an attack , especially since gryphons don \u2019 t tolerate altitude nearly as well as dragons , probably due to the fact that they \u2019 re half-lion , half-eagle and can \u2019 t handle the thinner air at higher altitudes .",
  "There\u2019 s a reason we\u2019ve been able to fend off every major assault on our territory for the last six hundred years, and we\u2019ve successfully defended ourland in this never -ending four-hundred-year -long war. Our abilities, both lesser and signet , are superior because our dragons can channel more power than gryphons. So why attack in that mountain range? What caused the wards to falter there? \u201cCome on, first-years, show me you have more than just good balance. Show me you have the critical-t hinking skills to be here,\u201d Profe ssor Devera demands. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that you\u2019re ready for what\u2019 s beyond our borders.\u201d \u201cIs this the first time the wards have faltered?\u201d a first-year a couple of rows ahead asks. Professors Devera and Markham share a look before she turns toward the cadet. \u201cNo.\u201d My heart jolts into my throat and the room falls pin-drop quiet. It\u2019s not the first time.",
  "The girl clears her throat. \u201cAnd how\u2026often are they faltering?\u201d Professor Markh am\u2019s shrewd eyes narrow on her. \u201cThat\u2019 s above your pay grade, cadet.\u201d He turns his atten tion to our section. \u201cNext relevant question to the attack we\u2019re discussing?\u201d \u201cHow many casualties did the wing suffer?\u201d a first-year down the row to my right asks. \u201cOne injured dragon. One dead rider .\u201d Another murmu r rises from the hall. Surviving graduation doesn\u2019 t mean we\u2019ll survive service. Statistica lly, most riders die before retirement age, especially at the rate riders have been falling over the last two years.",
  "\u201cWhy would you ask that partic ular question?\u201d Professor Devera asks the cadet. \u201cTo know how many reinforcements they\u2019ll need,\u201d he answers. Professor Dever a nods, turning toward Pryor , the meekest first-year in our squad, who has his hand up, but he lowers it quickly , scrunching his dark eyebrows. \u201cDid you want to ask a question?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d He nods, sending a few locks of black hair into his eyes, then shakes his head. \u201cNo. Never mind.\u201d \u201cSo decisive,\u201d Luca\u2014the catty first-year in our squad I\u2019ll do just about anything to avoid \u2014mocks from next to him, tilting her head as cadets laugh around them. A corner of her mouth tilts up into a smirk, and she flips her long brown hair over her shou lder in a move that\u2019s anything but casual. Like me, she\u2019s one of the few women in the quadrant who didn\u2019t cut her hair. I envy her confidence that it won\u2019 t be used against her, but not her attitude, and I\u2019ve known her less than a day . \u201cHe\u2019 s in our squad,\u201d Aurelie\u2014at least I think that\u2019s her name\u2014chastises, her no-nonsense black eyes narrowing on Luca. \u201cShow some loyalty .\u201d \u201cPlease.",
  "No dragon is bonding to a guy who can\u2019t even decide if he wants to ask a question. And did you see him at breakfast this mornin g? He held the entire line up because he couldn\u2019 t choose between bacon or sausage.\u201d Luca rolls her kohl-rimmed eyes. \u201cIf Four th Wing is done picking at one another?\u201d Professor Devera asks, lifting a brow . \u201cAsk what altitude the village is at,\u201d I whisper to Rhiannon. \u201cWhat?\u201d Her brow furrows. \u201cJust ask,\u201d I reply , trying to keep Dain\u2019 s advice in mind. I swear I can feel him staring at the back of my neck from seven rows behind me, but I\u2019m not going to turn and look, not when I know Xaden\u2019 s up there somewhere, too. \u201cWhat altitude is the village at?\u201d Rhiannon asks. Professor Devera\u2019 s eyebrows rise as she turns to Rhiannon. \u201cMarkham?\u201d \u201cA little less than ten thousand feet,\u201d he answers.",
  "\u201cWhy?\u201d Rhiannon darts a dose of side-ey e at me and clears her throat. \u201cJust seems a little high for a planned attack with gryphons.\u201d \u201cGood job,\u201d I whisper . \u201cIt is a little high for a planned attack ,\u201d Devera says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me why that\u2019s bothersome, Cadet Sorrengail? And maybe you\u2019d like to askyour own questions from here on out.\u201d She levels a stare on me that has me squirming in my seat. Every head in the room turns in my direction. If anyone had an inkling of doubt about who I am, it\u2019 s long gone now .",
  "Awesome . \u201cGryphons aren\u2019 t as strong at that altitude, and neither is their ability to channel,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s an illogical place for them to attack unless they knew the wards would fail, especially since the village looks to be about what\u2026 an hour\u2019s flight from the nearest outpost?\u201d I glance at the map to be sure I\u2019m not making a fool of myself. \u201cThat is Chakir right there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Scribe\u2019 s training for the win. \u201cIt is.\u201d A corner of Professor Devera\u2019 s mouth lifts into a smirk. \u201cKeep going with that line of thought.\u201d Wait a second. \u201cDidn\u2019 t you say it took an hour for the squad of rider s to arrive?\u201d My gaze narrows. \u201cI did.\u201d She looks at me with expectation. \u201cThen they were already on their way,\u201d I blurt, immediately recognizing how silly that sounds. My cheeks heat as a mumble of laughter sounds around me. \u201cYeah, because that makes sense.\u201d Jack turns around in his seat from the front row and openly laughs at me. \u201cGeneral Melgren knows the outcome of a battle before it happens, but even he doesn\u2019 t know when it will happen, dumbass.\u201d I feel the chuckling of my class mates reverberate in my bones. I want to crawl under this ridiculous desk and disappear .",
  "\u201cFuck of f, Barlowe,\u201d Rhiannon snaps. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who thinks precognition is a thing,\u201d he retorts with a sneer . \u201cGods help us if that one ever gets on the back of a drago n.\u201d Another round of laughter has my neck flaming, too. \u201cWhy do you think that, Violet\u2014\u201d Professor Markham winces. \u201cCadet Sorrengail?\u201d\u201cBecause there\u2019 s no logical way they get there within an hour of the attack unless they were already on their way,\u201d I argue, shooting a glare at Jack. Fuck him and his laughter . I might be weaker than he is, but I\u2019m a hell of a lot smarter . \u201cIt would take at least half that long to light the beacons in the range and call for help, and no full squad is sitting around just waiting to be needed.",
  "More than half those riders would have been asleep, which means they were already on their way .\u201d \u201cAnd why woul d they already be on their way?\u201d Professor Devera prods, and the light in her eyes tells me I\u2019m right, giving me the confidence to take my train of thought a step further . \u201cBecause they somehow knew the wards were breaking.\u201d I lift my chin, simultaneously hoping I\u2019m right and praying to Dunne\u2014the goddess of war \u2014that I\u2019m wrong. \u201cThat\u2019 s the most\u2014\u201d Jack starts. \u201cShe\u2019 s right,\u201d Professor Devera interrupts, and a hush falls over the room. \u201cOne of the dragons in the wing sensed the faltering ward, and the wing flew. Had they not, the casualties would have been far higher and the destruction of the village much worse.\u201d A little bubble of confidence rises in my chest, which is prompt ly popped by Jack\u2019 s glare, telling me he hasn\u2019 t forgotten his promise to kill me. \u201cSecond- and third-years, take over,\u201d Professor Devera orders. \u201cLet\u2019 s see if you can be a little more respectful to your fellow cadets.\u201d She arches a brow at Jack as questions begin to fire of f from the riders behind us.",
  "How many riders were deployed to the site? What killed the lone fatality? How long did it take to clear the village of the gryphons? Were any left alive for questioning? I write down every question and answer , my mind organizing the facts into what kind of report I would have filed if I\u2019d been in the Scribe Quadrant, which information was important enough to includ e, and whatwas extraneous. \u201cWhat was the condition of the village?\u201d a deep voice asks from the back of the lecture hall. The hairs on my neck rise, my body recognizing the imminent threat behind me.",
  "\u201cRiorson?\u201d Markham asks, shielding his eyes from the mage lights as he looks toward the top of the hall. \u201cThe village,\u201d Xaden restates. \u201cProfessor Devera said the damage would have been worse, but what was the actual condition? Was it burned? Destroyed? They wouldn\u2019 t demolish it if they were trying to establish a foothold, so the condition of the village matters when trying to determine a motive for the attack.\u201d Professor Devera smiles in approval. \u201cThe buildings they\u2019d already gone through were burned, and the rest were being looted when the wing arrived.\u201d \u201cThey were looking for something,\u201d Xaden says with complete conviction. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019 t riches. That\u2019 s not a gem mining district. Which begs the question, what do we have that they want so badly?\u201d \u201cExactly . That\u2019 s the question.\u201d Professor Devera glances around the room. \u201cAnd that right there is why Riorson is a wingleader . You need more than strength and courage to be a good rider .\u201d \u201cSo what\u2019 s the answer?\u201d a first-year to the left asks. \u201cWe don\u2019t know ,\u201d Professor Devera answers with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s just another piece in the puzzle of why our constant bids for peace are rejected by the kingdom of Poromiel. What were they looking for?",
  "Why that village? Were they responsible for the collapse of the ward, or was it already faltering? Tomorrow , next week, next month, there will be another attack, and maybe we\u2019ll get another clue. Go to history if you\u2019re looking for answers. Those wars have already been dissected and examined. Battle Brief is for fluid situations. In this class, we want you to learn whichquestions to ask so all of you have a chance at coming home alive.\u201d Something in her tone tells me it\u2019s not just third-years who might be called into service this year , and a chill settles in my bones. \u2026 \u201cYou seriously knew every answer in history and apparently every right question to ask in Battle Brief,\u201d Rhiannon says, shaking her head as we stand on the sidelines of the sparring mat after lunch, watching Ridoc and Aurelie circle each other in their fighting leathers. They\u2019re evenly matched in size. Ridoc is on the smalle r side, and Aurelie is built just like Mira, which doesn\u2019 t surprise me because she\u2019s a legacy on her father\u2019s side. \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to have to study for tests, are you?\u201d The rest of the first-years stand on our side, but the second- and third- years line the others. They\u2019re definitely at an advantage here, considering they\u2019ve already had at least a year of combat training.",
  "\u201cI was trained to be a scribe. \u201d I shrug, and the vest Mira made me shimmers slightly with the movement. Other than the times the scales catch the light under the camouflaging mesh, it fits right in with the tops we\u2019d been given from central issue yesterday . All the women are dressed similarly now , though the cuts of their leathers are chosen by preference. The guys are mostly shirtless because they think shirts give their opponent something to grab onto. Personally , I\u2019m not arguing with their logic, just enjoy ing the view\u2026respectfully , of course, which means keeping my eyes on my own squad\u2019 s mat and off the other twenty mats in the massive gym that consumes the first floor of the academic wing. One wall is made entirely of windows and doors, all left open to let in the breeze, but it\u2019s still stiflingly hot.",
  "Sweat trickles down my spine under my vest. There are three squads from each wing here this afternoon, and lucky me, First Wing has sent their third squads, which include Jack Barlowe, who\u2019 s been glaring at me from two mats over since I walked in.\u201cGuess that means you\u2019re not worried about academics,\u201d Rhiannon says, her brow s rising at me. She\u2019s chosen a leather vest, too, but hers cuts in above the collar bone and secures at her neck, leaving her shoulders bare for movement. \u201cStop circling each other like you\u2019re dance partners and attack!\u201d Professor Emet terio orders from across the mat, where Dain watches Aurelie and Ridoc\u2019 s match with our squad executive leader , Cianna. Thank God Dain\u2019s shirt is on, because I don\u2019t need another distractio n when it\u2019s time for my turn. \u201cI\u2019m worried about this,\u201d I tell Rhiannon, tilting my chin toward the mat. \u201cReally?\u201d She shoots me a skeptical look. Her braids are twisted into a small bun at the nape of her neck. \u201cI figured as a Sorrengail, you\u2019d be a hand-to-hand threat.\u201d \u201cNot exactly .\u201d At my age, Mira had been training in hand-to-hand for twelve years.",
  "I have a whopping six months under my belt, which wouldn\u2019 t matter as much if I wasn\u2019 t as breakable as a porcelain teacup, but here we are. Ridoc launches toward Aurelie, but she ducks, sweeping out her leg and tripping him. He staggers but doesn\u2019 t go down. He pivots quickly , palming a dagger in his hand. \u201cNo blades today!\u201d Professor Emetterio bellows from beside the mat. He\u2019s only the fourth professor I\u2019ve met, but he\u2019s definitely the one who intimidates me most.

  "\u201cW e\u2019re just assessing!\u201d Ridoc grumbles and sheathes his knife just in time to deflect a right hook from Aurelie. \u201cThe brunette packs a punch,\u201d Rhiannon says with an appreciative smile before glancing my way . \u201cWhat about you?\u201d I ask as Ridoc lands a jab to Aurelie\u2019 s ribs. \u201cShit!\u201d He shakes his head and backs up a step. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurtyou.\u201d Aurelie holds her ribs but lifts her chin. \u201cWho said you hurt me?\u201d \u201cPulling your punches does her a disservice,\u201d Dain says, folding his arms. \u201cThe Cygnis on the northeast border aren\u2019 t going to give her any quarter because she\u2019s a woman if she falls from her dragon behind enemy lines, Ridoc. They\u2019ll kill her just the same.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019 s go!\u201d Aurelie shouts, beckoning Ridoc by curling her fingers. It\u2019s obvious that most cadets have trained their whole lives to enter the quadrant, especially Aurelie, who slips a jab from Ridoc and twists to land a quick tap to his kidneys. Ouch. \u201cI mean\u2026damn,\u201d Rhiannon mutters, giving Aurelie another look before turning back to me. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good on the mat. My village is on the Cygnisen borde r, so we all learned to defend ourselves fairly young.",
  "Physics and math aren\u2019 t probl ems, either . But history?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cThat class might be the death of me.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t kill you for failing history ,\u201d I say as Ridoc charges Aurelie, taking her to the mat with enou gh force to make me wince. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to die on these mats.\u201d She hooks her legs around his and somehow leverages him over until she\u2019s the one on top, landing punch after punch to the side of his face. Blood spatters the mat. \u201cI could probably offer some tips to survive combat training,\u201d Sawyer says from Rhian non\u2019s other side, running his hand over a day\u2019s growth of brown stubble that doesn\u2019 t quite cover his freckles. \u201cHistory isn\u2019t my strongest subject, though.\u201d A tooth goes flying and bile rises in my throat. \u201cEnough!\u201d Professor Emetterio shouts. Aurelie rolls of f Ridoc and stands, touching her fingers to her split lip and examining the blood, then of fers her hand to help him up.He takes it. \u201cCianna, take Aurelie to the healers. No reason to lose a tooth during assessment,\u201d Emetterio orders.",
  "\u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal,\u201d Rhiannon says, locking her brown eyes with mine. \u201cLet\u2019 s help each other out. We\u2019ll help you with hand-to-hand if you help us with history . Sound like a deal, Sawyer?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely .\u201d \u201cDeal.\u201d I swallow as one of the third-years wipes down the mat with a towel. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m getting the better end of that.\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019 t seen me try to memorize dates,\u201d Rhiannon jokes. A coupl e of mats over, someon e shrieks, and we all turn to look. Jack Barlowe has another first-year in a headlock. The other guy is smaller , thinner than Jack, but still has a good fifty pounds on me. Jack yanks his arms, his hands still secure around the other man\u2019 s head. \u201cThat guy is such an ass\u2014\u201d Rhiannon starts. The sickening crack of bones breaking sounds across the gym, and the first-year goes limp in Jack\u2019 s hold. \u201cSweet Malek,\u201d I whisper as Jack drops the man to the ground.",
  "I\u2019m starting to wonder if the god of death lives here for how often his name must be invoked. My lunch threatens to reappear , but I breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth, since it\u2019s not like I can shove my head between my knees here. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d their instructo r shouts as he charges onto the mat. \u201cYou broke his damned neck!\u201d \u201cHow was I supposed to know his neck was that weak?\u201d Jack ar gues. You\u2019re dead, Sorrengail, and I\u2019m going to be the one to kill you.

You and you.\u201d Hepoints to Rhiannon and another first-year in our squad, a man with a stocky build, blue-blac k hair, and angular features. Shit, I can\u2019t remember his name. Trevor? Thomas, mayb e? There are too many new people to remember who is who at this point.",
  "I glance at Dain, but he\u2019 s watching the pair as they take the mat. Rhiannon makes quick work of the first-year , stunning me every time she dodges a punch and lands one of her own. She\u2019s fast, and her hits are powerful, the kind of lethal combination that will set her apart, just like Mira. \u201cDo you yield?\u201d she asks the first-year guy when she takes him to his back, her hand stopped mid-hit just above his throat. Tanner? I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019 s something that starts with a T . \u201cNo!\u201d he shouts, hooking his legs around Rhiannon\u2019 s and slamming her to her back. But she rolls and quickly gains her feet before putting him in the same position again, this time with her boot to his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know , Tynan, you might want to yield,\u201d Dain says with a grin. \u201cShe\u2019 s handing you your ass.\u201d Ah, that\u2019 s right. T ynan. \u201cFuck off, Aetos!\u201d Tynan snaps, but Rhiannon presses her boot into his throat, garbling the last word. He turns a mottled shade of red.",
  "Yeah, T ynan has more ego than common sense. \u201cHe yields,\u201d Emetterio calls out, and Rhiannon steps back, offering her hand. Tynan takes it.",
  "\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Emetterio points to the pink-haired second-year with the rebellion relic. \u201cAnd you.\u201d His finger swings to me. She\u2019s at least a head taller than me, and if the rest of her body is as toned as her arms, then I\u2019m pretty much fucked. I can\u2019 t let her get her hands on me. My heart threatens to beat out of my chest, but I nod and step onto themat. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d Rhianno n says, tapping my shoulder as she passes me. \u201cSorrengail.\u201d The pink-haired girl looks me over like I\u2019m something she\u2019 s scraped off the side of her boot, narrowing her pale green eyes. \u201cYou really should dye your hair if you don\u2019t want everyone to know who your mother is. You\u2019re the only silver -haired freak in the quadrant.\u201d \u201cNever said I cared if everyone knows who my mother is.\u201d I circle the second-year on the mat. \u201cI am proud of her service to protect our kingdom \u2014from enemies both without and within.\u201d As her jaw tightens at the dig, a bubble of hope rises in my chest. Marked ones, as I\u2019d heard some people this morning refer to those carrying rebellion relics on their arms, blame my mother for the execution of their parents. Fine. Hate me.",
  "Mom often says the minute you let emotion enter a fight, you\u2019ve already lost. I\u2019ve never prayed harder that my ice-in-her -veins mother was right. \u201cYou bitch,\u201d she seethes. \u201cY our mother murdered my family .\u201d She lunges forward and swings wildly , and I quickly sidestep, spinning away with my hands up. We do that for a few more rounds, and I land a few jabs, start to think that my plan might just work. She grow ls low in her throat as she misses me again, and her foot flies at my head. I easily duck, but then she drops to the ground and kicks out with her other foot, which lands square in my chest, sending me backward. I hit the mat with a thud, and she\u2019 s already above me, so damn fast. \u201cYou can\u2019 t use your powers in here, Imogen!\u201d Dain shouts. Imogen is trying her best to kill me. Her eyes are above mine, and I feel the quick slide of somet hing hard against my ribs as she smiles at me. But her smile fades as we both look down, and I can\u2019 t help but notice a dagger being re-sheathed. The armor just saved my life. Thank you, Mira.",
  "Confusion mars Imogen\u2019 s face for just a second, long enough for me tosend my fist into her cheek and roll out from under her . My hand screams with pain even though I\u2019m sure I formed the fist right, but I block it out as we both gain our feet. \u201cWhat kind of armor is that?\u201d she asks, staring at my ribs as we circle each other . \u201cMine.\u201d I duck and dodge as she comes at me again, but her movements are a blur . \u201cImogen!\u201d Emetterio shouts. \u201cDo it again, and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d I swerve the wrong way this time and she catches me, taking me to the floor . The mat smacks my face, and her knee digs into my back as she pulls my right arm behind me. \u201cYield!\u201d she shouts. I can\u2019t. If I yield on the first day, what will the second bring?",
  "\u201cNo!\u201d Now I\u2019m the one lacking common sense like T ynan, and I\u2019m far more breakable. She pulls my arm farther , and pain consumes every thought, blackening the edges of my vision. I cry out as the ligaments stretch, shred, then pop. \u201cYield, V iolet!\u201d Dain yells. \u201cYield!\u201d Imogen demands. Gasping for breath against the weight of her on my back, I turn my face to the side as she wrenches my shoulder apart, the pain consuming me. \u201cShe yields,\u201d Emetterio says. \u201cThat\u2019 s enough.\u201d I hear it again\u2014 the macabre sound of snapping bone\u2014but this time it\u2019s mine.It is my opinion that of all the signet powers riders pr ovide, mending is the most pr ecious, but we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent when in the company of such a signet.

  "It\u2019s basically a stone bridge, covered and sided with more stone , which pretty much makes it a suspended tunnel with a few windows, but I\u2019m not thinking clearly enough to take it in as we rush through, his strides eating up the distance. \u201cAlmost there,\u201d he reassures me, his grip firm but careful on my rib cage and beneath my knees as my useless arm rests on my chest. \u201cEveryone saw you lose it,\u201d I whisper , doing my best to mentally block the pain like I have countless times before. It\u2019s usually as easy as building a mental wall around the pulsing torment in my body , then telling myself the pain only exists in that box so I can\u2019t feel it, but it isn\u2019t working so well this time. \u201cI didn\u2019 t lose it.\u201d He kicks the door three times when we reach it. \u201cYou shouted and carried me out of there like I mean something to you.\u201d I focus on the scar on his jaw, the stubble on his tan skin, anything to keep from feeling the utter destruction in my shoulder . \u201cYou do mean something to me.\u201d He kicks again. And now everyone knows.The door swings open and W inifred, a healer who has been at my side too many times to mention, stands back so Dain can carry me in.",
  "\u201cAnother injury? You riders certainly are trying to fill our beds to\u2014 Oh no, Violet?\u201d Her eyes fly wide. \u201cHi, W inifred,\u201d I manage over the pain. \u201cThis way.\u201d She leads us into the infirmary , a long hall of beds, half of which are full of people in rider black. Healers do not have magic, relying on traditional tinctures and medical training to heal as best they can, but menders do. Hopefully Nolon\u2019 s around tonight, since he\u2019 s been mending me for the last five years. The signet of mending is exceptionally rare among riders. They have the power to fix, to restore, to return anything to its original state\u2014from ripped cloth to pulverized bridges, including broken human bones. My brother , Brennan, was a mender\u2014and would have become one of the greatest had he lived.",
  "Dain gently lays me onto the bed Winifred brings us to, then she leans into the edge of the mattress, near my hip. Every creased line in her face is a comfort as she strokes a weat hered hand across my forehead. \u201cHelen, go get Nolon,\u201d W inifred orders a healer in her forties walking by . \u201cNo!\u201d Dain barks, panic lacing his tone. Excuse me? The middle-aged healer glances between Dain and W inifred, clearly torn. \u201cHelen, this is Violet Sorrengail, and if Nolon finds out she was here and you didn\u2019 t call him, well\u2026 that\u2019s on you,\u201d Winifred says in a deceptive ly calm tenor . \u201cSorrengail?\u201d the healer repeats, her voice rising.

  "unconsciousness and all I can do is moan. \u201c Get Nolon or he will let his dragon eat you alive , sour face and all , Helen. \u201d Winifred arches a silver eyebrow as she ignores Dain insisting again not to call the mender . The woman blanches and disappears.

You want to see her suffer?\u201d Winifred lectures. \u201cI told her they\u2019d break you,\u201d she mutters as she leans over me, her gray eyes full of worry as she assesses me.

Absolutely not.",
  "Y our mother is so damned stubborn.\u201d She reaches for my injured arm, and I wince as she raises it a couple of inches, prods my shoulder . \u201cWell, that\u2019s certainly broken.\u201d Winifred tsks, raising her brows at the sight of my arm. \u201cAnd it looks like we need a surgeon for that shoulder . What happened?\u201d she asks Dain. \u201cSparring,\u201d I explain in one word. \u201cYou hush. Save your energy.\u201d Winifred looks back at Dain. \u201cMake yourself useful, boy, and pull the curtain around us.",
  "The fewer people who see her injured, the better .\u201d He jumps to his feet and quickly complies, drawing the blue fabric around us to make a small but effective room, separating us from the other riders who have been brought in. \u201cDrink this.\u201d Winifred brings out a vial of amber liquid from her belt. \u201cIt will handle the pain while we get you sorted.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019 t ask him to mend her ,\u201d Dain protests as she uncorks the glass. \u201cThe pair of us have been mending her for the past five years,\u201d she lectures, bringing the vial closer . \u201cDon\u2019 t start telling me what I can and cannot do.\u201dDain slides one hand under my back, the other under my head, helping me sligh tly upright so I can get the liquid down.

  "It\u2019 s only been a day .\u201d As his reasoning for not wanting a mender sinks in, my anger is able to pierce through the pain long enough for me to bite out, \u201cI\u2019m not going to the scribes.\u201d Then I sigh, closing my eyes as a pleasant hum races through my veins. Soon there\u2019 s enough distance between me and the pain to think somewhat clearly as I force my eyes open again. At least, I think it\u2019s soon, but there\u2019 s a conversation going on I clearly haven\u2019 t been paying attention to, so it\u2019 s obviously been a few minutes.

I added my own bits of hard-earned wisdom here and there, but mostly it\u2019s his, and I know he\u2019d want you to have it. He\u2019d want you to live. Love, Mira. I swallow past the knot in my throat and set the note aside. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Rhiannon asks. \u201cIt\u2019s my brother \u2019s.\u201d The words barely make it past my lips as I open the cover .",
  "Mother burned everything he owned after he died, as tradition dictates. It\u2019s been ages since I\u2019ve seen the bold strokes of his handwriting, and yet there they are. My chest tightens and a fresh wave of grief sweeps through me. \u201cThe book of Brennan,\u201d I read along with the first page and then flip to the second.",
  "Mira, You\u2019re a Sorrengail, so you will survive. Perhaps not as spectacularly as I have, but we all can\u2019t live up to my standar ds, can we? All kidding aside, this is everythin g I\u2019ve learned. Keep it safe. Keep it hidden. You have tolive, because V iolet is watching. Y ou can\u2019 t let her see you fall. Brennan. Tears prick my eyes, but I blink them back. \u201cIt\u2019s just his journ al,\u201d I lie, thumbing through the pages. I can hear his quippy , sarcastic tone as I skim over his words, as though he\u2019s standing here, making light of every danger with a wink and a grin. Damn, I miss him. \u201cHe died five years ago.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d Rhiannon leans in, her eyes heavy with sympathy . \u201cWe don\u2019t always burn everything, either . Sometimes it\u2019s nice to have something, you know?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d I whisper . It\u2019s everything to have this, and yet I know Mom will toss it in the fire if she ever finds it. Rhiannon sits back on her bed, opening her history book, and I fall back into Brennan\u2019 s history , starting on the third page. You survived Parapet. Good.",
  "Be observant the next few days, and don\u2019t do anything to draw attention to yourself.",
  "I\u2019ve sketched a map that shows you not only wher e the classr ooms are but wher e the instructors meet, too. I know you\u2019r e nervous about challenges, but you shouldn\u2019 t be, not with that right hook of yours. The matches might seem random, but they\u2019r e not. What the instructors don\u2019t tell you is that they decide challenges the week befor e, Mira. Any cadet can request a challenge, yes, but instructors will assign your matches based on weeding out the weakest. That means once the real hand-to-hand starts, the instructors already know who you\u2019ll be up against that day. Here\u2019s the secret\u2014if you know wher e to look and can get out without being seen, you\u2019ll know who you\u2019r e fighting so you can pr epare. I suck in a breat h and devour the rest of the entry , hope blossom ing in my chest. If I know who I\u2019m fighting, then I can begin the battle before weeven step on the mat. My mind spins, a plan taking shape. Two weeks, that\u2019s how long I have to get everything I\u2019ll need before challenges begin , and no one knows the grounds of Basgiath like I do. It\u2019s all here. A slow smile spreads across my face.",
  "I know how to survive.In the best inter est of pr eserving peace within Navarr e, no mor e than thr ee cadets carrying r ebellion r elics may be assigned to any squad of any quadrant. \u2014A DDENDUM 5.2, B ASGIA TH WAR COLLEGE CODE OF CONDUCT In addition to last year \u2019s changes, marked ones assembling in groups of thr ee or mor e will now be consider ed an act of seditious conspiracy and is her eby a capital offense. \u2014A DDENDUM 5.3, B ASGIA TH WAR COLLEGE CODE OF CONDUCT CHAPTER SEVEN \u201cDamn it,\u201d I mutter as my toe catches a rock, and I stumble in the waist- high grass that grows alongside the river beneath the citadel.",
  "The moon is nice and full, illuminating my way, but it means I\u2019m sweating to death in this cloak to keep hidden, just in case anyone else is out here wandering after curfew . The Iakobos River rushes with summer runof f from the peaks above, and the currents are fast and deadly this time of year, especially coming out of the steep drop of the ravine. No wonder that first-year died when he fell in yesterday during our downtime. Since Parapet, our squad is the only one in the quadrant not to lose anyone, but I know that\u2019s unlikely to last much longer in this ruthless school. Tightening my heavy satchel over my sling, I move closer to the river, along the ancien t line of oaks where I know one vine of fonilee berries will be comi ng into season soon. Ripe, the purple berries are tart and barely edible but, picked prematurely and left to dry, will make an excellentweapon in the growing arsenal that nine nights of sneaking out has given me. This was exactly the reason I brought the book of poisons with me. Challenges start next week, and I need every possible advantage.",
  "Spotting the boulder I\u2019ve used as a landmark for the past five years, I count the trees on the riverbank. \u201cOne, two, three,\u201d I whisper , spotting the exact oak I\u2019ll need. Its branches spread wide and high, some even daring to reach out over the river. Lucky for me, the lowest is easily climbable, even more so with the grass oddly trampled underneath. A twinge of pain shoots up through my shoulder as I slip my right arm out of the sling and begin to climb by moonlight and memory . The pain quickly fades to an ache, just like it has every evening while Rhiannon has been kicking my ass on the mat. Hopefully tomorrow Nolon will let me out of the annoying sling for good. The fonilee vine looks deceptively like ivy as it winds up the trunk, but I\u2019ve scaled this particular tree enough times to know this is the one. I\u2019ve just never had to climb the damn thing in a cloak before.",
  "It\u2019s a pain in my ass. The fabric catches on almost every branch as I move upward, slowly and steadily , climbing past the wide branch where I used to spend hours reading. \u201cShit!\u201d My foot slips on the bark and my heart stutters for a heartbeat while my feet find better holds . This would be so much easier during the day, but I can\u2019 t risk being caught. Bark scrapes my palms as I climb higher . The tips of the vine leaves are white at this height, barely visible in the mottled moonlight through the canopy , but I grin as I find exactly what I\u2019ve been searching for . \u201cThere you are.\u201d The purple berries are a gorgeous, unripe lavender .",
  "Perfect. Digging my fingernails into the branch above me, I manage to keep from wobbling long enough to retrieve an empty vial in my satchel and uncork it with my teeth. Then I pluck just enough berries off the vine to fill the glass and shove the stopper back in. Between these, the mushrooms I\u2019vealready hunted tonight, and the other items I\u2019ve collected, I should be able to make it through the next month of challenges. I\u2019m almost down the tree, only a handful of branches to go, when I spot movement beneath me and pause. Hopefully it\u2019 s just a deer . But it\u2019 s not. Two figures in black cloaks\u2014apparently tonight\u2019 s disguise of choice\u2014 walk under the protection of the tree. The smaller one leans back against the lowest limb, removing her hood to reveal a half-shaved head of pink hair I know all too well. Imogen, the squadmate who nearly ripped of f my arm ten days ago. My stom ach tightens, then knots as the second rider slips off his own hood. Xaden Riorson. Oh shit.",
  "There\u2019 s maybe fifteen feet betw een us and nothing\u2014and no one\u2014out here to stop him from killing me. Fear clenches my throat and holds tight as I white-k nuckle the branches around me, debating the merits of holding my breath so he can\u2019t hear me versus falling out of the tree if I faint from lack of oxygen. They begin speaking, but I can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying, not with the river rushing by. Relief fills my lungs.",
  "If I can\u2019t hear them, they can\u2019t hear me, either , as long as I sit tight. But all it takes is for him to look up, and I\u2019ll be toast, literally if he decides to feed me to that Blue Daggertail of his. The moonlight I was thankful for a few minutes ago has now become my biggest liability . Slowly , carefully , quietly , I move out of the patchy moonlight to the next branch over, cloaking myself in shadow . What is he doing out here with Imogen? Are they lovers? Friend s? It\u2019s absolutely none of my business, and yet I can\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019s the kind of woman he goes for\u2014one whose beauty is only outmatched by her brutality . They fucking deserveeach other . Xaden turns away from the river, as though he\u2019s looking for someone, and sure enough, more riders arrive, gathering under the tree. They\u2019re all dressed in black cloaks as they shake hands. And they all have rebellion relics. My eyes widen as I count. There are almost two dozen of them, a few third-years and a couple of seconds, but the rest are all firsts. I know the rules.",
  "Marked ones can\u2019t gather in groups larger than three. They\u2019re committing a capital offense simply by being together . It\u2019s obviously a meeting of some sort, and I feel like a cat clinging to the leaf-tipped limbs of this tree while the wolves circle below . Their gathering could be completely harmless, right? Maybe they\u2019re homesick, like when the cadets from the Morraine province all spend a Saturday at the nearby lake just because it reminds them of the ocean they miss so much. Or maybe marked ones are plotting to burn Basgiath to the ground and finish what their parents started. I can sit up here and ignore them , but my complacency\u2014my fear\u2014could get people killed if they\u2019re down there scheming. Telling Dain is the right thing to do, but I can\u2019 t even hear what they\u2019re saying. Shit. Shit. Shit.",
  "Nausea churns in my stomach. I have to get closer . Keeping myself on the opposi te side of the trunk and sticking to the shadows that wrap around me, I climb down another branch with sloth-like speed, holding my breath as I test each branch with a fraction of my weight before lowering myself. Their voices are still muffled by the river, but I can hear the loudest of them, a tall, dark-haired man with pale skin, whose shoulders take up twice the space of any first-year , standing opposite Xaden\u2019 s position and wearing the rank of a third-year . \u201cWe\u2019ve already lost Sutherland and Luperco,\u201d he says, but I can\u2019t make out the response.It takes two more rungs of branches before their words are clear . My heart pounds like it\u2019s trying to escape my ribs. I\u2019m close enough for any one of them to see if they look hard enough\u2014well, everyone except Xaden, since his back is turned toward me. \u201cLike it or not, we\u2019re going to have to stick together if you want to survive until graduation,\u201d Imogen says.",
  "One little hop to the right and I could repay that callous shoulder maneuver she pulled on me with a quick kick to her head. I just happen to value my own life more than I want revenge at the moment, so I keep my feet to myself. \u201cAnd if they find out we\u2019re meeting?\u201d a first-year girl with an olive complexion asks, her eyes darting around the circle. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this for two years and they\u2019ve never found out,\u201d Xaden responds, foldin g his arms and leaning back against the limb below my right. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to unless one of you tells. And if you tell, I\u2019ll know .\u201d The threat is obvious in his tone. \u201cLike Garrick said, we\u2019ve already lost two first-ye ars to their own negligence. There are only forty-one of us in the Riders Quadrant, and we don\u2019t want to lose any of you, but we will if you don\u2019t help yourselves. The odds are always stacked against us, and trust me, every other Navarrian in the quadrant will look for reasons to call you a traitor or force you to fail.\u201d There\u2019 s a muttered assent, and my breath hitches at the intensity in his voice. Damn it, I don\u2019t want to find a single thing about Xaden Riorson admirable, and yet here he is, being all annoyingly admirable. Asshole.",
  "Have to admit, it would be nice if a high-ranking rider from my province gave a shit if the rest of us from the province lived or died. \u201cHow many of you are getting your asses handed to you in hand-to- hand?\u201d Xaden asks. Four hands shoo t into the air, none of which belong to the spiky-blond- haired first-year standing with his arms crossed, a head taller than mostothers. Liam Mairi.",
  "He\u2019s in Second Squad, Tail Section of our wing and already the top cadet in our year. He practically ran across the parapet and destroyed every opponent on assessment day . \u201cShit,\u201d Xaden swears, and I would give anything to see his expression as he lifts a hand to his face. The big one\u2014Garrick\u2014sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll teach them.\u201d I recognize him now. He\u2019s the Flame Section leader in Fourth Wing. My direct superior above Dain. Xaden shakes his head. \u201cY ou\u2019re our best fighter\u2014\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re our best fighter ,\u201d a second-year near Xaden counters with a quick grin. He\u2019s hands ome, with tawny brown skin crowned by a cloud of black curls and a litany of patches on what I can see of his uniform under his cloak. His featu res are close enough to Xaden\u2019 s that they migh t be related. Cousins, maybe? Fen Riorson had a sister , if I remember correctly . Shit, what was the guy\u2019s name? It\u2019s been years since I read the records, but I think it started with a B. \u201cDirtiest fighter , maybe,\u201d Imogen snarks. Most everyone laughs, and even the first-years crack a smile.",
  "\u201cFucking ruthless is more like it,\u201d Garrick adds. There\u2019 s a general consensus of nods, including one from Liam Mairi. \u201cGarrick is our best fighter , but Imogen is right up there with him, and she\u2019s a hell of a lot more patie nt,\u201d Xaden notes, which is just ludicrous considering she didn\u2019 t seem too patient while breaking my arm. \u201cSo the four of you split yourselves up between the two of them for training. A group of three won\u2019 t draw any unwanted attention. What else is giving you trouble?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019 t do this,\u201d a gangly first-year says, rolling his shoulders inward and lifting his slim fingers to his face. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Xaden asks, his voice taking on a hard edge. \u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d The smaller one shakes his head. \u201cThe death. Thefighting. Any of it!\u201d The pitch of his voice rises with every statement. \u201cA guy had his neck snapped right in front of me on assessment day!",
  "I want to go home! Can you help me with that?\u201d Every head swings toward Xaden. \u201cNo.\u201d Xaden shrugs. \u201cY ou\u2019re not going to make it. Best accept it now and not take up more of my time.\u201d It\u2019s all I can do to smother my gasp, and some of the others in the group don\u2019t bother trying. What. A. Dick. The smaller guy looks stricken , and I can\u2019 t help but feel bad for him. \u201cThat was a little harsh, cousin,\u201d the second-year who looks a little like Xaden says, lifting his eyebrows. \u201cWhat do you want me to say, Bodhi?\u201d Xaden cocks his head to the side, his voice calm and even. \u201cI can\u2019t save everyone, especially not someone who isn\u2019 t willing to work to save themselves.\u201d \u201cDamn, Xaden.\u201d Garrick rubs the bridge of his nose. \u201cWay to give a pep talk.\u201d \u201cIf they need a fucking pep talk, then we both know they\u2019re not flying out of the quadrant on graduation day. Let\u2019s get real.",
  "I can hold their hands and make them a bunch of bullshit empty promises about everyon e making it through if that helps them sleep, but in my experience, the truth is far more valuable.\u201d He turns his head, and I can only assume he\u2019s looking at the panicked first-ye ar. \u201cIn war, people die. It\u2019s not glorious like the bards sing about, either . It\u2019s snapped necks and two-hundred-foot falls. There\u2019 s nothing romantic about scorched earth or the scent of sulfur . This\u201d\u2014he gestures back toward the citadel\u2014\u201cisn\u2019 t some fable where everyone makes it out alive. It\u2019s hard, cold, uncaring reality . Not everyone here is going to make it home\u2026 to whatever \u2019s left of our homes. And make no mistake, we are at war every time we step foot in the quadrant.\u201d He leans forward slightly . \u201cSo if you won\u2019 t get your shit together and fight to live, then no. You\u2019re not going to make it.\u201dOnly crickets dare to break the silence. \u201cNow , someone give me a problem I can actually solve,\u201d Xaden orders. \u201cBattle Brief,\u201d a first-year I recognize says softly . Her bunk is only a row away from Rhiannon\u2019 s and mine. Shit\u2026what\u2019 s her name?",
  "There are too many women in the hall to know everyone, but I\u2019m certain she\u2019s in Third Wing. \u201cIt\u2019 s not that I can\u2019 t keep up, but the information\u2026\u201d She shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019 s a tough one,\u201d Imogen responds, turning to look at Xaden. Her profile in the moonlight is almost unrecognizable as the same person who shredded my shoulder . That Imogen is cruel, vicious even. But the way she\u2019s looking at Xaden softens her eyes, her mouth, her whole posture as she tucks a short strand of pink hair behind her ear . \u201cYou learn what they teach you,\u201d Xaden says to the first-year , his voice taking a hard edge. \u201cKeep what you know but recite whatever they tell you to.\u201d My brow furrows.",
  "What the hell does he mean by that? Battle Brief is one of the class es taught by scribes to keep the quadrant up-to-date on all nonclassified troop movements and battle lines. The only things we\u2019re asked to recite are recent events and general knowledge of what\u2019 s going on near the front lines. \u201cAnyone else?\u201d Xaden asks. \u201cYou\u2019d better ask now. We don\u2019t have all night.\u201d It hits me then\u2014other than being gathered in a group of more than three, there\u2019 s nothing wrong with what they\u2019re doing here. There\u2019 s no plot, no coup, no danger . It\u2019s just a group of older riders counseling first-years from their province. But if Dain knew , he\u2019d be honor bound to\u2014 \u201cWhen do we get to kill V iolet Sorrengail?\u201d a guy toward the back asks.",
  "My blood turns to ice. The murmur of assent among the group sends a jolt of terror down my spine. \u201cYeah, Xaden,\u201d Imogen says sweetly , lifting her pale green eyes to him.\u201cWhen do we get to finally have our revenge?\u201d He turns just enough for me to see his profile and the scar that crosses his face as he narro ws his eyes at Imogen. \u201cI told you already , the youngest Sorrengail is mine , and I\u2019ll handle her when the time is right.\u201d He\u2019ll\u2026handle me? My muscles thaw with the heat of indignation. I\u2019m not some inconvenience to be handled . My short-lived admiration of Xaden is over .",
  "\u201cDidn\u2019 t you already learn that lesson, Imogen?\u201d the look-alike Xaden chides from halfway down the circle. \u201cWhat I hear, Aeto s has you scrubbing dinne r dishes for the next month for using your powers on the mat.\u201d Imogen\u2019 s head snaps in his direction. \u201cHer mother is responsible for the execution of my mom and sister . I should have done more than just snap her shoulder .\u201d \u201cHer mom is responsible for the capture of nearly all our parents,\u201d Garrick counters , folding his arms over his wide chest. \u201cNot her daughter . Punishing children for the sins of their parents is the Navarrian way, not the Tyrrish.\u201d \u201cSo we get conscripted because of what our parents did years ago and shoved into this death sentence of a college\u2014\u201d Imogen starts. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t notice, she\u2019s in the same death sentence of a college,\u201d Garrick retorts. \u201cSeems like she\u2019 s already suf fering the same fate.\u201d Am I seriously watching them debate over whether I should be punished for being Lilith Sorrengail\u2019 s daughter? \u201cDon\u2019 t forget her brother was Brennan Sorrengail,\u201d Xaden adds. \u201cShe has just as much reason to hate us as we do her.\u201d He pointedly looks at Imogen and the first-yea r who raised the question.",
  "\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to tell you again. She\u2019 s mine to handle. Anyone feel like ar guing?\u201d Silence reigns. \u201cGood. Then get back to bed and go in threes.\u201d He motions with his head,and they slowly disperse, walking away in groups of threes just like he ordered. Xaden is the last to leave. I draw a slow breath.",
  "Holy shit, I just might live through this. But I have to be sure they\u2019re gone. I don\u2019t move a muscle, even when my thighs cramp and my fingers lock as I count to five hundred in my head, breathing as evenly as possible to soften the beats of my galloping heart. Only when I\u2019m sure I\u2019m alone , when the squirrels scurry past on the ground, do I finish climbing from the tree, jumping the last four feet to the grassy floor . Zihnal must have a soft spot for me, because I\u2019m the luckiest woman on the Continent\u2014 A shadow lunges behind me and I open my mouth to scream, but my air supply is cut off by an elbow around my neck as I\u2019m yanked against a hard chest. \u201cScream and you die,\u201d he whis pers, and my stomach plummets as the elbow is replaced by the sharp bite of a dagger at my throat. I freeze. I\u2019d recognize the rough pitch of Xaden\u2019 s voice anywhere. \u201cFucking Sorrengail.\u201d His hand yanks back the hood of my cloak. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d My tone is outright indignant, but whatever .",
  "If he\u2019s going to kill me, I\u2019m not going down as some simpering little beggar . \u201cLet me guess, you could smell my perfume. Isn\u2019t that what always gives the heroine away in books?\u201d He scoffs. \u201cI command shadows, but sure, it was your perfume that gave you away .\u201d He lowers the knife and steps away . I gasp. \u201cYour signet is a shadow wielder?\u201d No wonder he\u2019s risen so high in rank. Shadow wielders are incredibly rare and highly covete d in battle, able to disorient entire drifts of gryphons, if not take them down, depending upon the signet\u2019 s strength. \u201cWhat, Aetos hasn\u2019 t warned you not to get caught alone in the dark with me yet?\u201d His voice is like rough velvet along my skin, and I shiver , then draw myown blade from the sheath at my thigh and raise it as I spin toward him, ready to defend myself to the death. \u201cIs this how you plan to handle me?\u201d \u201cEavesdropping, were we?\u201d He arches a black brow and sheathes his dagger like I couldn\u2019 t possibly pose a threat to him, which only serves to piss me off even more. \u201cNow I might actually have to kill you.\u201d There\u2019 s an undertone of truth in those mocking eyes.",
  "This is just\u2026bullshit. \u201cThen go ahead and get it over with.\u201d I unsheathe another dagger , this one from beneath my cloak where it was strapped in at my ribs, and back up a couple of feet to give me distance to throw them\u2014if he doesn\u2019 t rush me. He pointedly looks at one dagg er, then the other , and sighs, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cThat stance is really the best defense you can muster? No wonder Imogen nearly ripped your arm of f.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m more dangerous than you think,\u201d I flat-out bluster . \u201cSo I see. I\u2019m quaking in my boots.\u201d The corner of his mouth rises into a mocking smirk. Fucking. Asshole.",
  "I flip the daggers in my hand, pinching them at the tips, then flick my wrists and fire them past his head, one on each side. They land solidly in the trunk of the tree behind him. \u201cYou missed.\u201d He doesn\u2019 t even flinch. \u201cDid I?\u201d I reach for my last two blades. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you back up a couple of steps and test that theory?\u201d Curiosity flares in his eyes, but it\u2019s gone in the next second, masked by cold, mocking indif ference. Every one of my senses is on high alert, but the shadows around me don\u2019t slide in as he moves backward, his eyes locked with mine. His back hits the tree, and the hilts of my daggers brush his ears. \u201cTell me again that I missed,\u201d I threaten, taking the dagger in my right hand by the tip.\u201cFascinating. You look all frail and breakable, but you\u2019re really a violent little thing, aren\u2019 t you?\u201d An appreciative smile curves his perfect lips as shadows dance up the trunk of the oak, taking the form of fingers. They pluck the daggers from the tree and bring them to Xaden\u2019 s waiting hands. My breath abandons me with a sharp exhale. He has the kind of power that could end me without him having to so much as lift a finger \u2014shadow wielding.",
  "The futility of even trying to defend myself against him is laughable. I hate how beautiful he is, how lethal his abilities make him as he strides toward me, shadows curling around his footsteps. He\u2019s like one of those poisonous flowers I\u2019ve read about from the Cygnis forests to the east. His allure is a warning not to get too close, and I am definitely too close. Switching my grip to the hilts of my daggers, I prepare for the attack. \u201cYou should show that little trick to Jack Barlowe,\u201d Xaden says, turning his palms upward and of fering me my daggers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d This is a trick.

  "\u201cThe neck-snapping first-year who\u2019 s very publicly vowed to slaughter you,\u201d Xaden clarifies as my blade presses against his cloak at the level of his abdomen. He reaches under my own cloak and slides one blade into the sheath at my thigh, then pulls back the side of my cloak and pauses. His gaze locks onto the length of my braid where it falls over my shoulder , and I could swear he stops breathing for a heartbeat before he slides the remaining dagge r into one of the sheaths at my ribs. \u201cHe\u2019d probably think twice about plotting your murder if you threw a few daggers at his head.\u201d This is\u2026this is\u2026bizarre. It has to be some kind of game meant to confuse me, right? And if so, he\u2019 s playing it really fucking well. \u201cBecause the honor of my murder belongs to you?\u201d I challenge. \u201cYou wanted me dead long before your little club chose my tree to meet under , soI imagine you\u2019ve all but buried me in your mind by now .\u201d He glances at the dagger poised at his stomach. \u201cDo you plan on telling anyone about my little club?\u201d His eyes meet mine, and there\u2019 s nothing but cold, calculating death waiting there. \u201cNo,\u201d I answer truthfully , suppressing a shiver . \u201cWhy not?\u201d He tilts his head to the side, examining my face like I\u2019m an oddity .",

My stomach twists just like it did before I stepped out onto the parapet, like my body knows that whatever action I take next will determ ine my life- span. \u201cYou were helping them. I don\u2019t see why that should be punished.\u201d It wouldn\u2019 t be fair to him or the others. Was their little meeting illegal? Absolutely . Should they die for it? Absolutely not. And that\u2019s exactly what will happen if I tell. Those first-years will be executed for nothing more than asking for tutoring, and the senior cadets will join them just because they helped. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell.\u201d He looks at me like he\u2019s trying to see through me, and ice prickles my scalp.",
  "My hand is steady , but my nerves tremble at what the next thirty seconds might bring. He can kill me right here, toss my body into the river, and no one will know I\u2019m gone until they find me downstream. But I won\u2019 t let him end me without drawing his blood first, that\u2019s for damn sure. \u201cInteresting,\u201d he says softly . \u201cWe\u2019ll see if you keep your word, and if you do, then unfortu nately , it looks like I owe you a favor .\u201d Then he steps away , turns, and walks off, heading back toward the staircase in the cliff that leads up to the citadel.Wait. What? \u201cYou\u2019re not going to handle me?\u201d I call after him, shock raising my brows. \u201cNot tonight!\u201d he tosses over his shoulder .

  "W ell, except Dain. He cares about every rule. Dain. My chest tightens, and I smile as I finish braiding my hair into a crown. Seeing him is the best part of my day, even the moment s when he\u2019s anything but personable in public. Even in the moments where he\u2019s consumed with trying to save me from this place. I grab my bag on the way out, passing by rows of empty beds that belonged to the dozen women who haven\u2019 t survived to see August, and shove open the door . There he is. Dain\u2019 s eyes light up as he pushes off the wall of the hallway where he\u2019sobviously been waiting for me. \u201cMorning.\u201d I can\u2019t help the smile that curves my lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to escort me to duty every morning, you know .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the only time I get to see you when I\u2019m not your squad leader ,\u201d he counters as we walk down the empty hallway , past the halls that will lead to our rooms if we survive Threshing. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s worth getting up an hour early , though I still can\u2019t figure out why you\u2019d choose breakfast duty over every other assignment.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI have my reasons.\u201d Really , really , really good reasons. Though I do miss the extra hour of sleep I\u2019d had before we chose our assignments last week.",
  "A door on the right flies open, and Dain darts in front of me, dragging me behind him with his arm so I face-plant into his back. He smells like leather and soap and\u2014 \u201cRhiannon?\u201d he snaps. \u201cSorry!\u201d Rhiannon\u2019 s eyes widen. I slip out of Dain\u2019 s hold and move to his side so I can see her. \u201cI wondered where you were this morning.\u201d A grin spreads across my face as Tara appears next to her . \u201cHey , Tara.\u201d \u201cHey , Violet.\u201d She gives me a wave, then heads down the hallway , tucking her shirt into her pants. \u201cWe have curfew for a reason, cadet,\u201d Dain lectures, and I fight the urge to roll my eyes. \u201cAnd you know that no one is supposed to be in the private dorms until after Threshing.\u201d \u201cMaybe we were just up early ,\u201d Rhiannon counters. \u201cYou know , like you are right now.\u201d She glances between the two of us with a mischievous smirk. Dain rubs the bridge of his nose. \u201cJust\u2026get back to the dorms and pretend you slept there, will you?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d She squeezes my hand as she passes by .\u201cWay to go,\u201d I whisper quickly .",
  "She\u2019s had a thing for Tara since we got here. \u201cI know, right?\u201d She backs away with a smile, then turns to push through the hall doors. \u201cMonitoring the sex lives of first-years was not what I had in mind when I applied to be a squad leader ,\u201d Dain mutters, and we continue toward the kitchen. \u201cOh, come on. Like you weren\u2019 t a first-year yourself last year .\u201d He lifts his brows in thought and eventually shrugs. \u201cFair point. And you\u2019re a first-year now\u2026\u201d His eyes slide my way as we near the arched doorways that lead to the rotunda, and his lips part like he\u2019s going to continue, but he looks away , pivoting to open the door for me. \u201cWhy , Dain Aetos! Are you asking me about my sex life?\u201d I let my fingers trail along the exposed fangs of the green dragon pillar and bite back a smile as we walk by . \u201cNo!\u201d He shakes his head, then pauses in thought. \u201cI mean\u2026is there a sex life to ask about?\u201d We climb the steps that lead into commons, and I turn just before the door to face him. He\u2019s two steps below me, putting us at eye level. \u201cSince I got here?\u201d I tap my chin with my finger and smile. \u201cThat\u2019 s none of your business. Before I got here?",
  "Still none of your business.\u201d \u201cAnother fair point.\u201d His mouth curves into a grin that makes me wish it was his business, though. I turn around before I do something utterly foolish like make it his business.",
  "We continue into commons, walking past the empty study tables and the entrance to the library . It\u2019s nothing as awe-inspiring as the scribes\u2019 Archives, but it has every tome I\u2019ll need for studying here. \u201cAre you ready for today?\u201d Dain asks as we near the gathering hall. \u201cFor the challenges to start this afternoon?\u201d My stomach knots.\u201cI\u2019ll be all right ,\u201d I assure him, but he moves in front of me, halting my steps. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been practicing with Rhiannon, but\u2026\u201d Worry lines his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d I promise, looking into his eyes so he knows I mean it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d Last night, Oren Seifert\u2019 s name was posted next to mine right where Brennan said it would be.

I\u2019m going to be challenged once a week just like every other cadet.",
  "And it\u2019s not going to stop there. You can\u2019t protect me from Threshing, or the Gauntlet, or Jack Barlowe\u2014\u201d \u201cYou need to lay low with that one.\u201d Dain grimaces. \u201cAvoid that pompous ass whenever you can, Vi. Don\u2019 t give him an excuse to come after you. He\u2019 s already responsible for too many names on the death roll.\u201d \u201cThen the dragons are going to love him.\u201d They always go for the vicious ones. Dain squeezes my hand gently . \u201cJust steer clear of him.\u201d I blink. The advice is so different from Xaden\u2019 s throw-a-few-d aggers-at- his-head approach. Xaden . The knot of guilt that\u2019s been lodged in my stomach since last week grows a fraction bigger . By code, I should tell Dain about seeing marked ones under the oak tree, but I won\u2019 t, not because I told Xaden that I wouldn\u2019 t but because keeping the secret feels like the right thing to do. I\u2019ve never kept a secret from Dain in my life.",
  "\u201cViolet? Did you hear me?\u201d Dain asks, lifting a hand to cradle my face.Jerking my gaze to his, I nod and repeat, \u201cSteer clear of Barlowe.\u201d He drops his hand and shoves it into a pocket of his pants. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll for get all about his little vendetta against you.\u201d \u201cDo most men forget when a woman holds a knife to their balls?\u201d I cock an eyebrow at him. \u201cNo.\u201d He sighs. \u201cYou know , it\u2019s not too late to sneak you down to the scribes. Fitzgibbons will take you\u2014\u201d The bells ring, marking quarter past five and saving me from another session of Dain begging me to run away to the Scribe Quadrant. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019ll see you at formation.\u201d I give his hand a squeeze, then walk away , leaving him as I make my way to the kitchen.",
  "I\u2019m always the first here, and today is no exception. I pocket the vial of dried, powd ered fonilee berries from my satchel and get started as the other worker s come in, sleepy-eyed and grumbly . The powder is nearly white, nearly invisible as I take my place in the serving line an hour later, and completely undetectable as I sprinkle it over Oren Seifert\u2019 s scrambled eggs when he approaches. \u2026 \u201c Keep the temperaments of each specific breed in mind when you decide which dragons to approach and which to run from at",
  "Threshing , \u201d Professor Kaori says , his serious , dark eyes slashing toward his nose as he studies the new recruits for a beat , then he changes the projection he \u2019 s conjured from a Green Daggertail to a Red Scorpiontail . He\u2019s an illusionist and the only professor in the quadrant with the signet ability to project what he sees in his mind , which makes this class one of my favorites. He\u2019s also the reason I knew exactly what Oren Seifert looked like. Do I feel guilty about blatantly misleading a professor about why I needed to find another cadet? No. Do I think it\u2019s cheating? Also no.",
  "I was doing exactly what Mira suggested and using my brain.The Red Scorpiontail in the center of our circled tables is a fraction of its actual size, six feet tall at most, but it\u2019s an exact replica of the actual firebreather waiting in the V ale for Threshing. \u201cRed Scorpiontails, like Ghrian here, are the quickest to temper ,\u201d Professor Kaori continues, his perfectly trimmed mustache curving as he smiles at the illusion like he\u2019s the dragon himself. We all take notes. \u201cSo if you of fend him, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d \u201cLunch,\u201d Ridoc says from my left, and the class laughs. Even Jack Barlowe, who hasn\u2019 t quit glaring at me since his squad took over their quarter of the room a half hour ago, snorts. \u201cPrecisely ,\u201d Professor Kaori responds. \u201cSo what\u2019 s the best way to approach a Red Scorpiontail?\u201d He glances around the room. I know the answer , but I keep my hand to myself, heeding Dain \u2019s advice to lay low . \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Rhiannon mutters next to me, and I huff a laugh under my breath. \u201cThey prefer that you approach from the left and from the front, if possible,\u201d a woman from one of the other squads answers.",
  "\u201cExcellent.\u201d Professor Kaori nods. \u201cFor this Threshing, there are three Red Scorpiontai ls willing to bond.\u201d The image changes in front of us to a different dragon. \u201cHow many dragons are there in total?\u201d Rhiannon asks. \u201cA hund red for this year,\u201d Professor Kaori answers, changing the image again. \u201cBut some might change their minds during Presentation in about two months, depending on what they see.\u201d My stom ach hits the floor . \u201cThat\u2019s thirty-seven fewer than last year.\u201d Maybe even fewer if they don\u2019t like the look of us after we have to parade by them for their perusal two days before Threshing. Then again, there\u2019 s usually fewer cadets after that particular event anyway . Professor Kaori\u2019 s dark eyebrows rise. \u201cYes, Cadet Sorrengail, it is, andtwenty-six fewer than the year before that.\u201d Fewer dragons are choosing to bond, but the number of riders entering the quadrant has remained stead y. My mind whirls. Attacks at the eastern borders are increasing, according to every Battle Brief, and yet there are fewer dragons willing to bond in order to defend Navarre.",
  "\u201cWill they tell you why they won\u2019 t bond?\u201d another first-year asks. \u201cNo, jackass,\u201d Jack scoffs, his icy-blue gaze narrowing on the cadet. \u201cDragons only talk to their bond ed riders, just like they only give their full name to their bonded rider . You should know that by now .\u201d Professor Kaori sends Jack a look that shuts the first-year \u2019s mouth but doesn\u2019 t stop him from sneering at the other cadet. \u201cThey don\u2019t share their reasons,\u201d our instructor says. \u201cAnd anyone who respects their life won\u2019 t ask a question they\u2019re not willing to answer .\u201d \u201cDo the numbers affect the wards?\u201d Aurelie asks from where she sits behind me, tapping her quill against the edge of her desk. She\u2019 s never happy sitting still. Professor Kaori\u2019 s jaw ticks twice. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure. The number of bonded dragons has never affected the integrity of",
  "Navarre \u2019 s wards before , but I \u2019 m not about to lie to you and say that we \u2019 re not seeing increased breaches when you know from Battle Brief that we are. \u201d The wards are faltering at a rate that makes my stomach tense every time Professor Devera starts our daily Battle Brief . Either we\u2019re weakening or our enemies are getting stronger . Both possibilities mean the cadets in this room are needed more than ever . Even me. The image changes to Sgaeyl, the navy-blue dragon bonded to Xaden. My stom ach pitches as I remem ber the way she looked right through me that first day . \u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about how to approach blue dragons, since there are none willing to bond this Threshing, but you should be able torecognize Sgaeyl if you see her ,\u201d Professor Kaori says.",
  "\u201cSo you can fucking run,\u201d Ridoc drawls. I nod along while others laugh. \u201cShe\u2019 s a Blue Daggertail, the rarest of the blues, and yes, if you see her without her bonded rider, you should\u2026definitely find somew here else to be. Ruthless does not begin to describe her, nor does she abide by what we assume to be what the dragons consider law. She even bonded the relative of one of her previous riders, which you all know is typically forbidden, but Sgaeyl does whatever she wants, whenever she wants. In fact, if you see any of the blues, don\u2019 t approach them. Just\u2026\u201d \u201cRun,\u201d Ridoc repeats, raking his hand through his floppy brown hair . \u201cRun,\u201d Professo r Kaori agrees with a smile, the mustache above his top lip quivering slightly . \u201cThere are a handful of other blues in active service, but you\u2019ll find them all along the Esben Mountains in the east, where the fighting is most intense. They\u2019 re all intimidating, but Sgaeyl is the most powerful of them all.\u201d My breath catches. No wonder Xaden can wield shadows\u2014shadows that can yank daggers out of trees, shadows that can probably throw those same daggers. And yet\u2026he let me live.",
  "I shove the kernel of warmth that thought gives me far , far away . Probably just to screw with you, a monster playing with his prey befor e pouncing. \u201cWhat about the black dragon?\u201d the first-year next to Jack asks. \u201cThere\u2019 s one here, right?\u201d Jack\u2019 s face lights up. \u201cI want that one.\u201d \u201cNot that it\u2019s going to matter .\u201d Professor Kaori flicks his wrist and Sgaeyl disappears, and a massive black dragon takes her place. Even the illusion is bigger , making me crane my neck slightly to see its head. \u201cBut just to appease your curiosity , since this is the only time you\u2019ll ever see him, here is the only other black besides General Melgren\u2019 s.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019 s huge,\u201d Rhiannon says. \u201cAnd is that a clubtail?\u201d \u201cNo. A morning startail. He has the same bludgeoning power of a clubtail, but those spikes will eviscerate a person just as well as a daggertail.\u201d \u201cBest of both worlds,\u201d Jack calls out. \u201cHe looks like a killing machine.\u201d \u201cHe is,\u201d Professor Kaori answe rs.",
  "\u201cAnd honestly , I haven\u2019 t seen him in the last five years, so this image is more than a little outdated. But since we have him up here, what can you tell me about black dragons?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re the smartest and most discerning,\u201d Aurelie calls out. \u201cThey\u2019re the rarest,\u201d I add in. \u201cThere hasn\u2019 t been one born in the last\u2026 century .\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d Professor Kaori spins the illusion again, and I\u2019m met with a pair of glaring yellow eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re also the most cunning. There\u2019 s no such thing as outsmarting a black dragon. This one is a little over a hundred, which makes him about middle-aged. He\u2019s revered as a battle dragon among their kind, and if not for him, we probably would have lost during the Tyrrish rebellion. Add to it that he\u2019s a morningstartail, and he\u2019s one of the deadliest dragons in Navarre.\u201d \u201cI bet he powers one hell of a signet. How do you approach him?\u201d Jack asks, leaning forward in his seat. There\u2019 s pure avarice in his eyes, mirrored by his friend next to him. That\u2019 s the last thing this kingdom needs, someone as cruel as Jack bonding to a black dragon.",
  "No thank you. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Professor Kaori answers. \u201c He hasn \u2019 t agreed to bond since his previous and only rider was killed during the uprising , and the only way you \u2019 d ever be near him is if you \u2019 re in the Vale , which you won \u2019 t be , because you \u2019 d be incinerated before you ever got through the gor ge. \u201d The pale redhea d across the circle from me shifts in her seat and tugs her sleeve down to cover her rebellion relic . \u201cSomeone should ask him again,\u201d Jack ur ges. \u201cIt doesn\u2019 t work that way, Barlowe. Now , there is only one other blackdragon, which is in service\u2014\u201d \u201cGeneral Melgre n\u2019s,\u201d Sawyer says.",
  "His book is closed in front of him, but I can\u2019t blame him. I\u2019d hardly be taking notes, either , if this was the second time I\u2019d gone through this class. \u201cCodagh, right?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Professor Kaori nods. \u201cThe eldest of their den and a swordtail.\u201d \u201cBut just for curiosity\u2019 s sake.\u201d Jack\u2019s glacial-blue gaze doesn\u2019 t stray from the illusion of the unbonded black dragon still being projected. \u201cWhat signet ability would this guy gift his rider?\u201d Professor Kaori closes his fist, and the illusion disappears. \u201cThere\u2019 s no telling. Signets are the result of the unique chemistry between rider and dragon and usually say more about the rider than the dragon. The stronger the bond and the more powerful the dragon, the stronger the signet.\u201d \u201cFine. What was his previous rider \u2019s?\u201d Jack asks. \u201cNaolin\u2019 s signet was siphoning.\u201d Professor Kaori\u2019 s shoulders fall. \u201cHe could absorb power from various sources, other dragons, other riders, and then use it or redistribute it.\u201d \u201cBadass.\u201d Ridoc\u2019 s tone has more than a little hero worship. \u201cHe was,\u201d Professor Kaori agrees. \u201cWhat kills someone with that kind of signet?\u201d Jack asks, crossing his arms over his thick chest.",
  "Professor Kaori glances at me for a heartbeat before looking away . \u201cHe attempted to use that power to revive a fallen rider\u2014which didn\u2019 t work, because there\u2019 s no signet capab le of resurrection\u2014and depleted himself in the process. To use a phrase you\u2019ll become accustomed to after Threshing, he burned out and died next to that rider .\u201d Something in my chest shifts, a feeling that I can\u2019t explain and yet can\u2019t shake. The bells ring, signaling the hour is up, and we all begin to gather our things. The squads filter out to the hallway , emptying the room, and I rise from behind my desk, shouldering my satchel as Rhiannon waits for me bythe door, a puzzled expression on her face. \u201cIt was Brennan, wasn\u2019 t it?\u201d I ask Professor Kaori. Sadness fills his gaze as he meet s mine.",
  "\u201cYes. He died trying to save your brother , but Brennan was too far gone.\u201d \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d I shift the weight of my satchel. \u201cResurrection isn\u2019t possible. Why would he essentially kill himself when Brennan was already gone?\u201d A stampede of grief tramples my heart, stealing my breath. Brennan never would have want ed anyone to die for him. That wasn\u2019t in his nature. Professor Kaori sits back agains t his desk, pulling at the short, dark hairs of his mustache as he stares at me. \u201cBeing a Sorrengail doesn\u2019 t do you any favors in here, does it?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cThere are more than a few cadets who would like to take me\u2014and my last name\u2014down a peg.\u201d He nods. \u201cIt won\u2019 t be like that once you leave. After graduation, you\u2019ll find that being General Sorren gail\u2019s daughter means others will do just about anything to keep you alive, even pleased, not because they love your mother but because they either fear her or want her favor .\u201d \u201cWhich was Naolin?\u201d \u201cA little bit of both.

  "\u2026 I\u2019m so nervous I could puke as I stand at the side of the wide black mat, watching Rhiannon beat the ever-loving shit out of her opponent. It\u2019s a guy from Second Wing, and it takes almost no time for her to get him into a headlock, cutting off his air supply . It\u2019s a move she\u2019s tried her best to drill into me over the last couple of weeks. \u201cShe makes it look so easy,\u201d I say to Dain as he stands at my side, his elbow brushing mine. \u201cHe\u2019 s going to try to kill you.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I glance up, then follow his line of sight two mats over . Dain\u2019 s glaring daggers at Xaden across the mat, a look of sheer boredom on his face as Rhiannon squeez es the neck of the Second Wing first-year tighter . \u201cYour opponent,\u201d Dain says softly . \u201cI overheard him and a few friends .They think you\u2019re a liability to the wing thanks to that Barlowe kid.\u201d His gaze shifts to Oren, who\u2019 s sizing me up like a damned plaything he\u2019s planning on breaking. But there\u2019 s a greenish twinge to his complexion that makes me grin. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fine,\u201d I recite , because that\u2019s my fucking mantra.",
  "I\u2019m stripped down to the dragon-scale vest that\u2019s starting to feel like a second skin and my fighting leathers. All four of my daggers are sheathed, and if my plan goes correctly , I\u2019ll have one more to add to my collection soon. The Second Wing first-year passes out, and Rhiannon rises victorious as we clap. Then she leans over her opponent and removes the dagger at his side. \u201cLooks like this is mine now. Enjoy your nap.\u201d She pats him on the head, which makes me laugh. \u201cNot sure why you\u2019re laughing , Sorrengail,\u201d a sneering voice calls out from behind me. I turn around and see Jack stand ing with his feet apart against the wood- planked wall about ten feet away , wearing a smile that can only be described as evil. \u201cFuck of f, Barlowe.\u201d I gift him the middle finger . \u201cI honestly hope you win today\u2019 s challenge.\u201d His eyes dance with a sadistic glee that makes me queasy. \u201cIt would be a shame for someone else to kill you before I get the chan ce.

  "Violets are such delicate\u2026fragile things, you know .\u201d Delicate, my ass. He\u2019d probably think twice about plotting your murder if you threw a few daggers at his head. I unsheathe both daggers from my ribs and flick them in his direction in one smooth movement. They land right where I intended\u2014 one nearly nicking his ear and the other an inch beneath his balls. Fear widens his eyes. I shamelessly grin and wiggle my fingers in a wave.\u201cViolet,\u201d Dain hisses as Jack maneuvers around my blades, stepping away from the wall. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that.\u201d Jack points at me and stalks off, but the rise and fall of his shoulders is a little choppy . I watch his back retreat, then retrieve my daggers, sheathing them at my ribs before returning to Dain\u2019 s side. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d he seethes.",
  "\u201cI told you to lay low when it comes to him, and you\u2026\u201d He shakes his head at me. \u201cYou just piss him off even more?\u201d \u201cLaying low wasn\u2019 t getting me anywhere,\u201d I say with a shrug as Rhiannon\u2019 s oppo nent is carried off the mat. \u201cHe needs to realiz e I\u2019m not a liability .\u201d And I\u2019ll be har der to kill than he thinks. There\u2019 s no ignoring the prickle at my scalp, and I let my gaze shift to meet Xaden\u2019 s. My heart does that damn stuttering thing again, as if he\u2019d sent shadows straight through my ribs to squeeze the organ. He lifts his scarre d brow , and I swear there\u2019 s a hint of a smile on his lips as he leaves, walking over to observe the Fourth W ing cadets at the next mat. \u201cBadass,\u201d Rhian non says as she moves to my other side. \u201cI thought Jack was going to shit himself.\u201d I smother a smile. \u201cStop encouraging her ,\u201d Dain chastises. \u201cSorrengail.\u201d Professor Emetterio glances at his notebook and raises one bushy black brow before continuing. \u201cSeifert.\u201d Swallowing back the panic that threatens to creep up my throat, I step onto the mat opposite Oren, who\u2019 s definitely looking green now . Right on time.",
  "I\u2019ve prepared the best I can, wrapping my ankles and my knees just in case he goes for the legs. \u201cDon\u2019 t take this personally ,\u201d he says as we start to circle, both our handsraised. \u201cBut you\u2019ll only be a hazard to your wing.\u201d He charges at me, but his footwork is sluggish and I spin away , landing a punch to his kidney before bouncing back on my heels and palming a dagger . \u201cI\u2019m no more a hazard than you are,\u201d I accuse. His chest heave s once and sweat dots his forehead, but he shakes it off, blinking rapidly as he reaches for his own knife. \u201cMy sister is a healer .",
  "I\u2019ve heard your bones snap like twigs.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come find out?\u201d I force a smile and wait for him to charge again, because that\u2019s what he does. I\u2019ve had three sessions to watch him from a few mats over . He\u2019 s a bull, all power and no grace. His entire body rolls like he\u2019s going to vomit, and he covers his mouth with his empty hand, breathing deeply before standing straight again. I should attack, but instead I wait. And then he char ges, his blade held high in a striking position. My heart pounds as I wait the torturous heartbeats it takes for him to reach me, my brain somehow convincing my body to hold my ground until the last possible second. He swings his knife downward, and I dodge to the left, nicking his side with my blade in the process, then turn and deliver a kick to his back, sending him sprawling. Now. He falls to the mat, and I take immediate advantage, digging a knee into his spine just like Imogen had with me and putting my blade to his throat.",
  "\u201cYield.\u201d Who needs strength when you have speed and steel? \u201cNo!\u201d he shouts, but his body undulates under mine, and he retches, bringing up everything he\u2019s eaten since breakfast and splattering it across the mat to the side of us. So fucking gross. \u201cOh my gods,\u201d Rhiannon calls out, disgust dripping from her tone. \u201cYield,\u201d I demand again, but he\u2019s heaving in earnest now and I have topull my knife away so I don\u2019 t accidentally slit his throat. \u201cHe yields,\u201d Professor Emetterio declares, his face contorted in revulsion. I sheathe my blade and climb off him, dodging the puddles of sick. Then I take the dagger Oren dropped a few feet back as he continu es to vomit. The knife is heavier and longer than my others, but it\u2019s mine now, and I earned it. I sheathe it in an empty place at my left thigh. \u201cYou won!\u201d Rhiannon says, clasping me in a hug as I walk of f the mat. \u201cHe\u2019 s sick,\u201d I say with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll take being lucky over being good any day ,\u201d Rhiannon counters. \u201cI have to find someone to get this cleaned up,\u201d Dain says, his own complexion turning peaked. I won. \u2026 Timing is the hardest thing about my plan.",
  "I win the next week when a stocky girl from First Wing can\u2019t concentrate long enough to throw a decent punch thanks to a few leighorrel mushrooms and their hallucinogenic propert ies that somehow wind up in her lunch. She gets in a good kick to my knee, but it\u2019s nothing a few days in a wrap won\u2019 t heal. I win the week after that when a tall guy from Third Wing stumbles because his large feet temporaril y lose all feeling, courtesy of the zihna root that grows on one outcropping near the ravine. My timing is off a little, though, and he lands a few good punches to my face, leaving me with a split lip and a bruise that colors my cheek for the next eleven days, but at least he doesn\u2019 t break my jaw . I win again the next week when a buxom cadet\u2019 s vision turns blurry mid- match, on account of the tarsilla leaves that found their way into her tea. She\u2019s fast, tossing me to the mat and delivering some overwhelmingly painful kicks to my abdomen that leave colorful contusions and one distinctboot print on my ribs. I almost broke down and went to see Nolon after that one, but I gritted my teeth and wrapped my ribs, determined not to give the others a reason to weed me out like Jack or any marked ones wanted.",
  "I earn my fifth dagger , this one with a pretty ruby in the hilt, the last challenge in August when I take a particularly sweaty guy with a gap between his front teeth to the mat. The bark of the carmine tree that finds its way into his waterskin makes him sluggish and ill. The effects are a little too similar to the fonilee berries, and it\u2019s just a shame that the entire Third Squad, Claw Section of Third Wing is suffering the same stomach upset. Must be something viral, at least that\u2019s what I say when he finally yields to my headlock after dislocating my thumb and nearly breaking my nose. Come early September , there\u2019 s a spring in my step as I walk onto the mat. I\u2019ve taken down five opponents without killing any of them, something a quarter of our year can\u2019t say after almost twenty more names have been added to the death roll the last month for the first-years alone. I roll my sore shoulders and wait for my opponent. But Rayma Corrie from Third Wing doesn\u2019 t step forward this week like she\u2019s supposed to. \u201cSorry , Violet,\u201d Professor Emetterio says, scratching his short black beard.",
  "\u201cYou were supposed to challenge Rayma, but she\u2019s been taken to the healers because she can\u2019 t seem to walk in a straight line.\u201d Peels of the walwyn fruit will do that when ingested raw\u2026say , like when they\u2019re mixed into the icing of your morning pastry . \u201cThat\u2019 s\u201d\u2014shit\u2014\u201ctoo bad.\u201d I wince. You served it to her too early. \u201cShould I just\u2026\u201d I start, already backing up to get of f the mat. \u201cI\u2019m happy to step in.\u201d That voice. That tone. That prickle of ice along my scalp\u2026 Oh no. Hell no. No. No. No.",
  "\u201cYou sure?\u201d Professor Emetterio asks, glancing over his shoulder . \u201cAbsolutely .\u201dMy stomach hits the floor . And Xaden walks onto the mat.I will not die today . \u2014V IOLET SORRENGAIL \u2019S PERSONAL ADDENDUM TO THE BOOK OF BRENNAN CHAPTER NINE I\u2019m so completely screwed. Xaden steps forward\u2014all six-foot-everything of him\u2014dressed in midnight fighting leathers and a tight-fitted short-sleeve shirt that only seems to make the shimmering, dark rebellion relics on his skin seem like an even bigger warning, which I know is ridiculous but somehow true. My heartbeat kicks up to a full gallop, as if my body knows the truth my mind hasn\u2019 t quite accepted yet. I\u2019m about to have my ass kicked\u2026or worse. \u201cYou are all in for a treat,\u201d Professor Emetterio says, clapping his hands. \u201cXaden\u2019 s one of the best fighters we have. W atch and learn.\u201d \u201cOf course you are,\u201d I mutter , my stomach twisting like I\u2019m the one who\u2019 s been snacking on walwyn fruit peels. A corner of Xaden\u2019 s mouth rises in a smirk, and the gold flecks in his eyes seem to dance. The sadistic ass is enjoying this.",
  "My knees, ankles, and wrist are wrapped, the white cloth protecting my healing thumb a startling contrast against my black leathers. \u201cA little out of her league, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Dain argues from the side of the mat, tension radiating from every word. \u201cRelax, Aetos.\u201d Xaden looks over my shoulder , his gaze hardening toward where I know Dain is standing, where he always stands when I\u2019m on the mat. The look Xaden gives him makes me realize he\u2019s been taking it easy on me in the glaring department. \u201cShe\u2019ll be in one piece when I\u2019mfinished teaching her.\u201d \u201cI hardly think it\u2019 s fair\u2014\u201d Dain\u2019 s voice rises. \u201cNo one asked you to think, squad leader ,\u201d Xaden fires back as he moves to the side, disca rding every weapon on his body\u2014and there\u2019 s a lot of them \u2014and handing them to Imogen. The bitter, illogical taste of jealo usy fills my mouth, but there\u2019 s no time to examine that particular oddity , not when there\u2019re only seconds before he\u2019s in front of me again. \u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need those?\u201d I ask, palming my own blades. His chest is massive, with wide shoulders and heavily muscled arms alongside. A tar get this big should be easy to hit.",
  "\u201cNope. Not when you brought enough for the both of us.\u201d A wicked smile curves his mouth as he stretches out his hand and curls his fingers in a come-hither motion. \u201cLet\u2019 s go.\u201d My heart beats faster than the wings of a hummingbird as I take a fighting stance and wait for him to strike. This mat is only twenty feet in either direction, and yet my entire world narrows to its confi nes and the danger within. He\u2019s not in my squad. He can kill me without punishment. I fling a dagger straight at his ridiculously well-sculpted chest. He fucking catches it and clucks his tongue. \u201cAlready seen that move.\u201d Holy shit is he fast. I have to be faster . It\u2019s the single advantage I have\u2014that\u2019 s my only thought as I move forward in a swipe-and-kick combo Rhiann on\u2019s drilled into me over the past six weeks. He artfully dodges my blade and then captures my leg. The earth spins and I slam onto my back, the sudden impact driving the air from my lungs. But he doesn\u2019 t go for the kill.",
  "Instead , he drops the dagger he \u2019 s caught and kicks it off the mat , and a second later , when air squeaks into my lungs , I lunge up with the next blade , going for his thigh.He blocks my strike with his forearm , then grips my wrist with his opposite hand and plucks the knife out of my hand , leaning down so his face is only inches from mine . \u201cGoing for blood today , are we, Violence?\u201d he whispers.",
  "Metal hits the mat again and he kicks it past my head and out of my reach. He\u2019s not taking my daggers to use against me; he\u2019s disarming me just to prove he can. My blood boils. \u201cMy name is Violet,\u201d I seethe. \u201cI think my version fits you better.\u201d He releases my wrist and stands, offering me a hand. \u201cW e\u2019re not done yet.\u201d My chest heaves , still recovering from the way he\u2019s knocked the wind out of me, and I take the offering. He tugs me to my feet, then twists my arm behind my back and yanks me against his hard chest, pinning our joined hands before I have a chance to get my balance. \u201cDamn it!\u201d I snap. There\u2019 s a tug at my thigh and another of my daggers is press ed to my throat as his chest rests against the back of my head. His forearm is locked across my ribs, and he might as well be a statue for all the give there is in his fram e. Ther e\u2019s no use slam ming my head back\u2014he\u2019 s so tall that I\u2019d only annoy him. \u201cDon\u2019 t trust a single person who faces you on this mat,\u201d he warns in a hiss, his breath warm against the shell of my ear, and even though we\u2019re surrounded by people, I realize he\u2019s quiet for a reason.",
  "This lesson is just for me. \u201cEven someone who owes me a favor?\u201d I counter , my voice just as low. My shou lder starts to protest the unnatural angle, but I don\u2019t move. I won\u2019 t give him the satisfaction. He drops the third dagger he\u2019s taken from me and kicks it forward\u2014to where Dain stands, the other two already in his hand. There\u2019 s murder in his eyes as he glares at Xaden.\u201cI\u2019m the one who decides when to grant that favor . Not you.\u201d Xaden releases my hand and steps back. I whirl, punching for his throat, and he knocks my hand aside. \u201cGood,\u201d he says with a smile, deflecting my next blow without so much as a hitch to his breath. \u201c Going for the throat is your best option , as long as it \u2019 s exposed. \u201d",
  "Fury makes me kick out again in the same pattern , muscle memo ry taking over , and he captures that leg again , this time snatching the dagger sheathed there and dropping it to the mat before he lets me go , cocking a disappointed eyebrow at me . \u201cI expect you to learn from your mistakes.\u201d He kicks it away .",
  "I only have five left, all sheathed at my ribs. Gripping one and putting my hands up defensively , I begin to circle him, and to my absolute annoyance, he doesn\u2019 t even bother facing me. He just stands there in the center of the mat, his boots planted and his arms loose as I move around him. \u201cYou going to prance or are you going to strike?\u201d Fuck him. I punch forward, but he dips and my knife sails over his shoulder , missing him by six inches. My stomach drops as he grips my arm, yanking me forward and flipping me aroun d the side of his body . I\u2019m airborne for a heartbeat before I smack into the mat, my ribs taking the impact. He cranks my arm into a submission hold and white-hot pain shoots down the limb as I cry out, dropping the dagger , but he\u2019s not done. No, his knee is in my ribs and, though he holds my arm captive with one hand, the other plucks a dagger from its sheath and flings it toward Dain\u2019 s feet before taking another and holding it to the tender area where my jaw meets my neck. Then he leans closer . \u201cTaking out your enemy before the battle is really smart; I\u2019ll give that to you,\u201d he whispers, his warm breath brushing the shellof my ear .",
  "Oh gods. He knows what I\u2019ve been doing. The pain in my arm is nothing compared to the nausea churnin g in my stomach at the thought of what he might do with that knowledge. \u201cProblem is, if you aren\u2019 t testing yourself in here\u201d\u2014he scrapes the dagger down my neck, but there\u2019 s no warm trickle of blood, so I know he hasn\u2019 t cut me\u2014\u201cthen you\u2019re not going to get any better .\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d rather I die, no doubt,\u201d I fire back, the side of my face pressed into the mat. This isn\u2019 t just painful, it\u2019 s humiliating. \u201cAnd be denied the pleasure of your company?\u201d he mocks. \u201cI fuckin g hate you.\u201d The word s are past my lips before I can shut my mouth. \u201cThat doesn\u2019 t make you special.\u201d The pressure releases from my chest and arm as he gets on his feet, kicking both daggers toward Dain. Two more. I only have two more, and now my indignation and anger far outweigh my fear . Ignoring Xaden\u2019 s outstretched hand, I gain my feet and his lips curve into an approving smile.",
  "\u201cShe can be taught.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019 s a quick learner ,\u201d I retort. \u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d He backs up two steps, putting a little space between us before crooking his fingers at me again. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your damn point ,\u201d I snap loud enough that I hear Imogen gasp. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve barely gotten started.\u201d He folds his arms and leans back on his heels, clearly waiting for me to move. I don\u2019 t think. I just act, going low and kicking out the backs of his knees. He goes down like a tree, the sound more than satisfying, and I pounce, trying for a headlock. Doesn\u2019 t matter how big someone is\u2014they still need air.",
  "Catching his throat in the crook of my elbow , I squeeze.Instead of going for my arms, he twists, grabbing ahold of the backs of my thigh s so I lose my leverage and our bodies careen into a roll. He comes out on top. Of course he does. His forearm rests against my throat, not cutting off air but definitely capable of it, and his hips have mine pinned, my legs useless on either side of his as he lies heavily between my thighs. He\u2019 s unmovable. Everything around us fades as my world narrows to the arrogant glint in his gaze. He\u2019 s all I can see, all I can feel. And I can\u2019 t let him win. I slip one of my last daggers free and go for his shoulder . He seizes my wrist and pins it above my head.",
  "Shit. Shit. SHIT . Heat rushes up my neck and flames lick my cheeks as he lowers his face so his lips are only inches away from mine. I can make out every speck of gold in his onyx eyes, every bump and ridge of his scar . Beautiful. Fucking. Asshole. My breath catches and my body warms, the traitorous bitch. You are not attracted to toxic men, I remind myself, and yet, here I am, getting all attracted. I have been since the first second I saw him, if I feel like being honest. He pushes his fingers into my fist, forcing it open, then sends the blade skittering across the mat before letting go of my wrist. \u201cGet your dagger ,\u201d he orders. \u201cWhat?\u201d My eyes fly wide. He has me defenseless and in the kill position already . \u201cGet. Your. Dagger,\u201d he repeats, taking my hand in his and retrieving the last blade I have. His fingers curl over mine, clasping the hilt. Fire races along my skin at the feel of his fingers lacing with mine. Toxic. Danger ous. Wants to kill you. Nope, doesn\u2019 t matter.",
  "My pulse stillskitters like a teenager . \u201cYou\u2019re tiny .\u201d He says it like an insult. \u201cWell aware.\u201d My eyes narrow . \u201cSo stop going for bigger moves that expose you.\u201d He drags the tip of the dagger down his side. \u201cA rib shot would have worked just fine.\u201d Then he guides our hands around his back, making himself vulnerable. \u201cKidneys are a good fit from this angle, too.\u201d I swallow , refusing to think of other things that are a good fit at this angle. He leads our hands to his waist , his gaze never leaving mine. \u201cChances are, if your opponent is in armor , it\u2019s weak here. Those are three easy places you could have struck before your opponent would have had time to stop you.\u201d They\u2019re also fatal wounds, and I\u2019ve avoided those at all costs. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d I nod. \u201cGood. Because you can\u2019t poison every enemy you come across,\u201d he whispers, and I blanche. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have time to offer tea to some Braevi gryphon rider when they come at you.\u201d \u201cHow did you know?\u201d I finall y ask. My muscles lock, including my thighs, which just happen to still be bracketing his hips. His eyes darken. \u201cOh, Violence, you\u2019re good, but I\u2019ve known better poison masters.",
  "The trick is to not make it quite so obvious.\u201d My lips part, and I bite back a retort that I was careful not to be obvious. \u201cI think she\u2019s been taught enough for the day,\u201d Dain barks, reminding me that we\u2019re far from alone. No, we\u2019re a damned spectacle. \u201cHe always that overprotective? \u201d Xaden grumbles, pressing up from the mat a few inches. \u201cHe cares about me.\u201d I glare at him. \u201cHe\u2019 s holding you back. Don\u2019 t worry . Your little poisoning secret is safewith me.\u201d Xaden arches a brow as if to remind me that I\u2019m the keeper of one of his secrets, too. Then he guides our hands back to my ribs and slides the ruby-hilted blade back into its sheath. The move is unnervingly\u2026hot. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to disarm me?\u201d I challenge as he releases his grip and pushes up more , removing his weight from my body . My ribs expand as I take my first full breath.",
  "\u201cNope. Defenseless women have never been my type. We\u2019re done for today .\u201d He stands, then walks away without another word, taking his weapons from Imogen as I roll to my knees. Every part of my body aches, but I manage to stand. There\u2019 s pure relief in Dain\u2019 s eyes when I reach his side to retrieve the daggers Xaden took from me. \u201cY ou all right?\u201d I nod, my fingers trembling as I rearm myself. He\u2019s had every chance, and every reason, to kill me, and now he\u2019s let me walk away twice . What kind of game is he playing? \u201cAetos,\u201d Xaden calls out from across the mat. Dain\u2019 s head snaps up and his jaw locks. \u201cShe could use a little less protection and a little more instruction.\u201d Xaden stares Dain down until he nods. Professor Emetterio calls the next challenge.",
  "\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m just surpris ed he let you live,\u201d Dain says later that night in his room as his thumbs dig into the muscle between my neck and shoulder . It hurts so deliciously , it was well worth the pain of sneaking up here. \u201cI hardly think he\u2019d command respect by snapping my neck on the mat.\u201d His blankets are soft against my belly and chest as I lay on his bed, bare from the waist up except for the constricting band around my breasts and ribs. \u201cBesides, that\u2019 s not his way .\u201dDain\u2019 s hands pause on my skin. \u201cBecause you know what his way is?\u201d The guilt of keeping Xaden\u2019 s secret makes my stomach drop. \u201cHe told me he didn\u2019 t see a reason to kill me himself when the parapet would do it,\u201d I answer truthfull y. \u201cAnd let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s had plenty of chances to take me out if he really wanted.\u201d \u201cHmm.\u201d Dain hums in that thoughtful tone of his, continuing to work out my stiff and aching muscles as he leans over from the side of his bed. Rhiannon drilled me for another two hours after dinner , and I was barely able to move by the end of it. Guess I wasn\u2019 t the only one Xaden scared this afternoon.",
  "\u201cDo you think he could be plotting against Navarre and still have bonded Sgaeyl?\u201d I ask, my cheek against his blanket. \u201cI did at first.\u201d His hands move down my spine, pressing into the knots that made lifting my arms almo st impossible that last half hour of training tonight. \u201cBut then I bonded Cath, and I realized that dragons would do anything to protect the Vale and their sacred hatching grounds. There\u2019 s no way any dragon would have bonded Riorson or any of the separatists if they weren\u2019 t honest about protecting Navarre.\u201d \u201cBut would a dragon even know if you were lying?\u201d I turn my head so I can see his face. \u201cYeah.\u201d He grins. \u201cCath would know because he\u2019s in my head. It\u2019s impossible to hide something like that from your dragon.\u201d \u201cIs he always in your head?\u201d I know it\u2019s against the rules to ask\u2014almost everything about bonds are off-limits for discussion, given how secretive dragons are, but it\u2019 s Dain. \u201cYeah,\u201d he answers, his smile softening. \u201cI can block him out if I need to, and they\u2019ll teach you that after Threshing\u2014\u201d His expression falls. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I sit up, sliding one of his pillows across my chest and leaning back against the headboard.",
  "\u201cI talked to Colo nel Markham this evening.\u201d He walks over and pulls hischair out from his desk and takes a seat, then rests his head in his hands. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d Fear races down my spine. \u201cIs it Mira\u2019 s wing?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Dain\u2019 s head snaps up, and there\u2019 s so much misery in his eyes that I swing my feet off the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that. I told him\u2026that I think Riorson wants to kill you.\u201d I blink, sitting fully back onto the bed.",
  "\u201cOh. Well, that\u2019s not really news, is it? Everyone who\u2019 s read a history of the rebellion can put two and two together , Dain.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, I told him about Barlowe, too, and Seifert.\u201d He rubs his hand over his hair. \u201cDon\u2019 t think I didn\u2019t notice the way Seifert shoved you into the wall before formation this morning.\u201d He lifts his brows at me. \u201cHe\u2019 s just pissed that I took his dagger at that first challenge.\u201d I squeeze the pillow tighter . \u201cAnd Rhiannon told me you found crushed flowers on your bed last week?\u201d He stares me down. I shrug. \u201cThey were just dead flowers.\u201d \u201cThey were mutilated violets .\u201d His mouth tightens and I go to him, resting my hands on his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they came with a death note or anything,\u201d I tease, stroking his soft brown hair . He looks up at me, the mage lights making his eyes a little brighter above his trim beard. \u201cThey\u2019re threats.\u201d I shrug. \u201cEvery cadet gets threatened.\u201d \u201cEvery cadet doesn\u2019 t have to wrap their knees every day ,\u201d he fires back. \u201cThe injured ones do.\u201d My brow furrows, annoyance taking root in my chest. \u201cWhy would you tell Markham about it anyway?",
  "He\u2019s a scribe, and there\u2019 s nothing he would do even if he could.\u201d \u201cHe said he\u2019d still take you,\u201d Dain blurts, his hands flying to my hips, holding me in place when I try to step away . \u201cI asked him if he\u2019d allow you into the Scribe Quadrant for your own safety , and he said yes. They\u2019d putyou with the first-years. It\u2019s not like you\u2019d have to wait until next Conscription Day or anything.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d I twist, breaking my hold, and back away from my best friend. \u201cI saw a way to get you out of danger , and I took it.\u201d He stands. \u201cYou went behind my back because you think I\u2019m not cutting it.\u201d The truth of the words tightens around my chest like a vise, cutting off my air instead of holding me together , leaving me weak and breathless. Dain knows me better than anyone , and if he still thinks I can\u2019t do this after I\u2019ve made it this far\u2026 Tears well in my eyes, but I refuse to let them fall. Instead, I tuck my chin and grab my dragon-scale vest, pull it over my head, then wren ch the laces together at the small of my back and tie them.",
  "Dain sighs. \u201cI never said I don\u2019 t think you can cut it, V iolet.\u201d \u201cYou say it every day!\u201d I snap. \u201cYou say it when you walk me from formation to class, which I know makes you late for flight line.

  "It\u2019 s designed to test your balance, str ength, and agility . The times don\u2019t matter for shit, only that you make it to the top. Reach for the r opes when you have to.

The zigzaggin g death trap of a trail rises above us, climbing in five distinct switchbacks of 180-degree turns, each increasing in difficulty on the way to the top of the bluff that divides the citadel from the flight field and the V ale. \u201cAmazing.\u201d Aurelie sighs. Rhiannon and I turn, both staring at her like she must have hit her head. \u201cYou think that hellscape looks amazing ?\u201d Rhiannon asks. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting years for this!\u201d Aure lie grins, her normally serious black eyes dancing in the morning sun as she rubs her hands together , shifting from one toned leg to the other in glee.",
  "\u201cMy dad\u2014he was a rider until he retired last year\u2014used to set up obstacle courses like this all the time so we could practice, and Chase, my brother , said it\u2019s the best part of being here before Threshing. It\u2019 s a real adrenaline rush.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019 s with the Southern Wing, right?\u201d I ask, focusing on the obstacle course running up the side of a fucking cliff. It looks more like a death trapthan an adrenaline rush, but sure, we can go with that. Positive thinking for the win, right? \u201cYep. Pretty much desk duty for all the action they see near the Krovlan border .\u201d She shrugs and points about two-thirds up the course. \u201cHe said to watch out for those giant posts jutting from the side of the cliff. They spin, and you can get crushed between them if you\u2019re not fast enough.\u201d \u201cOh, good, I was wondering when it might get difficult,\u201d Rhiannon mutters. \u201cThanks, Aurelie.\u201d I locate the series of nearly touching, three- foot-wide logs that jut out from the rocky terrain like a set of round steps rising from the ground to the switchback above it and nod. Go fast. Got it. You could have included that tidbit, Br ennan. The obstacle course is the embodiment of my worst nightmare.",
  "For the first time since Dain begged me to leave last week, I consider Markham\u2019 s offer. There are no death courses in the Scribe Quadrant, that\u2019 s for certain. But you\u2019ve already made it this far. Ahh, there she is, the little voice that\u2019s been riding my shoulder lately , daring to give me hope that I might actually survive Presentation. \u201cStill not sure why they call it the Gauntlet,\u201d Ridoc says from my right, blowing into his cupped hands to ward off the morning chill. The sun hasn\u2019 t touched this little crevice, but it\u2019s shining above the last quarter of the course. \u201cTo ensure dragons keep coming to Threshing by weeding out the weaklings.\u201d Tynan sneers from Ridoc\u2019 s other side, folding his arms over his chest as he casts a pointed look at me. I shoot him a glare and then shake it off. He\u2019s been pissy ever since Rhiannon handed his ass to him on the mat at assessment. \u201cKnock it the fuck of f,\u201d Ridoc snaps, earning the entire squad\u2019 s attention.",
  "My eyebrows lift. I \u2019 ve never seen Ridoc lose his temper or use anything but humor to defuse a situation before. \u201c What \u2019 s your problem ? \u201d Tynan shoves a strand of thick , dark hair from his eyes and pivots like he \u2019 s going to stare some intimidation into Ridoc , but it doesn \u2019 t really work out , seeing as Ridoc is twice as wide and half a foot taller . \u201cMy problem? You think because you made friends with Barlowe and Siefert that you have the right to be a dick to your own squadmate?\u201d Ridoc challenges. \u201cExactly . Squadmate .\u201d Tynan gestures toward the obstacle course. \u201cOur times aren\u2019t just ranked individually , Ridoc. We\u2019re scored as a squad, too, which is how the order for Presentation is decided. Do you really think any dragon wants to bond a cadet who walks in after every other squad in the processional?\u201d Fine, he has a point.",
  "It\u2019 s a shitty one, but it\u2019 s there. \u201cThey\u2019re not timing us for Presentation today , asshole.\u201d Rido c takes a step forward. \u201cStop.\u201d Sawyer shuffles between the two, shoving Tynan\u2019 s chest hard enough to make him stagger back into the girl behind him. \u201cTake it from someone who made it through Presentation last year: your time doesn\u2019 t mean anything. The last cadet to walk in last year bonded just fine, and some of the cadets in the first squad onto the field were passed over .\u201d \u201cLittle bitter about that, aren\u2019 t you?\u201d T ynan smirks. Sawyer ignores the barb. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not called the Gauntlet because it weeds out cadets.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s called the Gauntlet becaus e this is the cliff that guards the Vale,\u201d Professor Emetterio says, walk ing up behind our squad, his shaved head glinting in the growing sunlight. \u201cPlus, actual gauntlets\u2014armored gloves made of metal\u2014 are slippery as hell, and the name stuck about twenty years ago.\u201d He cocks a brow at Tynan and Sawyer . \u201cAre you two done arguing?",
  "Because all nine of you have exactly an hour to get to the top before it\u2019s another squad\u2019 s chance to practice, and from what I\u2019ve seen of your agilityon the mat, you\u2019re going to need every second.\u201d There\u2019 s a grumble of assent in our little group. \u201cAs you know , hand-to-hand challenges are on hold for the next two and a half weeks before Presenta tion so you can focus here.\u201d Professor Emetterio flips a page on the little notebook he carries. \u201cSawyer , you\u2019re going to show them how it\u2019s done, since you already have the lay of the land. Then Pryor , Trina, Tynan, Rhiannon, Ridoc, Violet, Aurelie, and Luca.\u201d A smile curves the harsh line of his mouth as he finishes calling out every name in our squad, and we file into order . \u201cYou\u2019re the only squad to remain intact since Parapet. That\u2019 s incredible. Your squad leader must be very proud. Wait here for a second.\u201d He walks past us, waving at someone high up on the clif f. No doubt that someone has a watch. \u201cAetos is especi ally proud of Sorrengail.\u201d Tynan gifts me with a mocking sneer once our instructor is out of hearing range.",
  "I see red. \u201cLook , if you want to talk shit about me, that\u2019s one thing, but leave Dain out of it.\u201d \u201cTynan,\u201d Sawyer warns, shaking his head. \u201cLike it doesn\u2019 t bother any of you that our squad leader is fucking one of us?\u201d T ynan throws out his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d I start, indignation getting the best of me before I can take a deep breath. \u201cHonestly , it\u2019s none of your godsdamned business who I\u2019m sleeping with, Tynan.\u201d Though if I\u2019m going to get accused, can\u2019t I have some of the perks? If I know Dain, he\u2019s hung up on the whole fraternization-is-discouraged-within-the-chain-of-command thing like this asshole. But surely Dain would actually make a move if he really wanted to, right? \u201cIt is if it means you get preferential treatment!\u201d Luca adds in. \u201cFor fuck\u2019 s sake,\u201d Rhiannon mumbles, rubbing the bridge of her nose. \u201cLuca, Tynan, shut up.",
  "They\u2019re not sleeping together . They\u2019ve been friendssince they were kids, or do you not know enough about our own leadership to know his dad is her mom\u2019 s aide?\u201d Tynan\u2019 s eyes widen, like he\u2019 s actually surprised. \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cReally .\u201d I shake my head and study the course. \u201cShit. I\u2019m\u2026sorry . Barlowe said\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s your first mistake ,\u201d Ridoc interjects. \u201cListenin g to that sadistic ass is going to get you killed. And you\u2019re lucky Aetos isn\u2019 t here.\u201d True. Dain would more than take exception to Tynan\u2019 s assumptions and probably assign him cleanup duty for a month. Good thing he\u2019s on the flight field this time of day . Xaden would just beat the shit out of him . I blink, shoving that comparison and any other thought of Xaden Riorson far out of my head. \u201cHere we go!\u201d Professor Emetterio walks to the head of our line.",
  "\u201c You \u2019 ll get your time at the top of the course , if you make it , but remember , you \u2019 ll still have nine practice sessions before we rank you for Presentation in two and a half week s , which will determine if the dragons find you worthy at Threshing. \u201d \u201c Wouldn \u2019 t it make more sense to let first-years start practicing this thing right after Parap et ? \u201d Rhiannon asks . \u201cYou know , to give us a little more time so we don\u2019 t die?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Professor Emetterio replies. \u201cThe timing is part of the challenge. Any words of wisdom, Sawyer?\u201d Sawyer blows out a slow breath, his gaze following the treacherous course. \u201cThere are ropes every six feet that run from the top of the sheer cliffside to the bottom,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if you start to fall, reach out and grab a rope. It\u2019ll cost you thirty seconds, but death costs you more.\u201d Awesome.",
  "\u201cI mean , there\u2019 s a perfectly good set of steps over there.\u201d Ridoc points to the steep staircase carved into the cliff beside the wide switchbacks of theGauntlet. \u201cStairs are for reaching the flight field on the top of the ridgeline after Presentation,\u201d Professor Emetterio says, then lifts his hands toward the course and flicks his wrist, pointing at various obstacles. The fifteen-foot log at the start of the uphill climb begins to spin. The pillars on the third ascent shake. The giant wheel at the first switchback starts its counterclockwise rotation, and those little posts Aurelie mentioned? They all twist in opposite directions. \u201cEvery one of the five ascents on this course is designed to mimic the challenges you\u2019l l face in battle.\u201d Professor Emetterio turns to look at us, his face just as stern as it is during our usual combat training.",
  "\u201c From the balance you must keep on the back of your dragon , to the strength you \u2019 ll need to hold your seat during maneuvers , to \u201d \u2014he gestures upward , toward the last obstacle that looks like a ninety-degree ramp from this angle\u2014 \u201c the stamina you \u2019 ll need to fight on the ground , then still be able to mount your dragon at a second \u2019 s notice. \u201d The posts knock a chunk of granite loose , and the rock tumbles down the course , smackin g every obstacle in its path until it crashes twenty feet in front of us .",
  "If there was ever a metaphor for my life, well\u2026that\u2019 s it. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Trina whispers, her brown eyes wide as she stares at the pulverized rock. I\u2019m the smallest of our squad, but Trina is the quietest, the most reserved. I can count on both hands the number of times she\u2019s spoken to me since Parapet. If she didn\u2019t have friends in First Wing, I\u2019d worry , but she doesn\u2019 t have to open up to us to survive the quadrant. \u201cYou all right?\u201d I ask her in a whisper . She swallows and nods, one of her auburn ringlet curls bouncing against her forehead. \u201cWhat if we can\u2019t make it up?\u201d Luca asks from my right, securing her long hair in a loose braid, her usual haughtiness not so in-your -face today .",
  "\u201cWhat\u2019 s the alternative route?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019 s no alternative. If you don\u2019t make it, you can\u2019t get to Presentation, can you? Take your position, Sawyer ,\u201d Professor Emetterio orders, and Sawyer moves to the beginning of the course. \u201cAfter he makes it past the final obstacle, so everyone can learn from this cadet completing the course, the rest of you will start every sixty seconds. And\u2026go!\u201d Sawyer is off like a shot. He easily runs the fifteen feet across the single log spinning parallel with the cliff face and then the raised pillars, but it takes him three rotations inside the wheel before he jumps through the lone opening, but other than that, I don\u2019t see a single misstep in the first ascent. Not. One. He turns and rushes toward a series of giant hanging balls that makes up the second ascent, jumping and hugging one after another .",
  "His feet back on the ground , he turns again and heads up the third ascent , whic h is divided into two section s. The first part has giant metal rods hanging parallel to the cliff wall , and he easily swings arm over arm , using his body \u2019 s weight and momentum to swing the bar forward and reach the next bar hanging half a foot higher than the previous as he climbs the side of the cliff . From the last bar, he jumps onto a series of shaking pillars that make up the second half of this ascent before finally leaping back onto the gravel path. By the time he reaches the fourth ascent, the spinning logs Aurelie\u2019 s brother warned us about, Sawye r\u2019s made it all look like child\u2019 s play, and I start to feel a bubble of hope that maybe the course isn\u2019t as difficult as it looks from the ground. But then he faces a giant chimney formation rising high above him at a twenty-degree angle and pauses.",
  "\u201cYou got this!\u201d Rhiannon yells from my side. As though he heard , he sprints toward the leaning chimney and flings",
  "himself upward , grabbing onto the sides by forming an X with his body , then starts hopping up the condu it until he reaches the end and drops down in front of the final obstacle , a massive ramp that reaches up to the top ofthe clif f \u2019 s edge at a nearly vertical climb . My breath catch es in my throat as Sawyer sprints toward the ramp, using his speed and momentum to carry him two-thirds of the way up the ramp. Just before he starts to fall, he reaches up with one arm and grasps the lip of the ramp and hauls himself over the edge. Rhiannon and I scream and cheer for him. He made it. In an almost flawless approach. \u201cPerfect technique!\u201d Professor Emetterio calls out. \u201cThat\u2019 s exactly what you should all be doing.\u201d \u201cPerfect, and yet he was still passed over at Threshing,\u201d Luca snarks. \u201cGuess the dragons have some sense of taste.\u201d \u201cGive it a rest, Luca,\u201d Rhi says.",
  "How could someone as smart and athletic as Sawyer not bond? And if he didn\u2019 t, what the hell kind of hope is there for the rest of us? \u201cI\u2019m too short for the ramp,\u201d I whisper to Rhi. She glances over at me, and then back to the obstacle. \u201cYou\u2019re wicked fast. If you get your speed up , I bet the momentum will take you to the top. \u201d Pryor\u2014the shy cadet from the Krovlan border region\u2014struggl es on the swinging steel rods in the third ascent due to some rather predictable hesitation on his part , but he makes it just as",
  "Trina nearly falls at the shaking pillars , reaching for a rope . I can only make out the flash of red from her hair when she starts the rotating stair steps, but I hear her scream all the way to my toes as that particular rope sways near the ground. \u201cYou can do it!\u201d Sawyer shouts down from the top. \u201cThey go in opposite directions!\u201d Aurelie calls up. \u201cTynan, start,\u201d Professor Emetterio orders, watching his pocket watch and not the course. My heart thuds in my ears when Trina makes it past the steps, and the drumming doesn \u2019t let up as Rhiannon is called to start. She passes the first ascent with the grace I\u2019ve come to expect from her before coming to a halt.Tynan hangs from the second of five buoy balls on the second ascent, right where the ground drops out. If he falls, he\u2019s got a minuscu le chance of hitting the single spinning log from the first ascent and overwhelming odds of dropping thirty feet to the ground below . \u201cYou have to keep moving, Tynan!\u201d I shout, though it\u2019s doubtful he can hear me from here.",
  "He might be a gullible ass, but he\u2019 s still my squadmate. He shrieks, his arms wrapped around the swinging ball. It\u2019s impossible for him to reach his hands completely around\u2014that\u2019 s the point, and he\u2019s slipping. \u201cHe\u2019 s going to screw her time,\u201d Aurelie says, blowing out a bored sigh. \u201cGood thing this is only practic e, then,\u201d Ridoc says, then bello ws up at Tynan. \u201cWhat\u2019 s the matter , Tynan?",
  "Scared of heights? Who\u2019 s the liability now?\u201d \u201cStop.\u201d I elbow Ridoc in the side. He\u2019s not quite as lean now. The last seven weeks have put some muscle on him. \u201cJust because he\u2019s a dick doesn\u2019 t mean you have to be.\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019s giving me so much material to work with,\u201d Ridoc replies, a corner of his mouth lifting into a smirk as he backs away , heading toward the starting position. \u201cSwing to the next one!\u201d T rina suggests from the top of the course. \u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Tynan\u2019 s shriek could break glass as it echoes down the mountain, and it makes my chest tighten. \u201cRidoc, start!\u201d Professor Emetterio commands. Ridoc char ges over the log. \u201cRhi!\u201d I shout up. \u201cThe rope is between the first and second!\u201d She nods down at me, then jumps for the first buoy ball, clasping it up top, near where the chains hold it to the iron rail above, and swinging her weight around the side.",
  "It\u2019s an utterly inspired approach, one that might just work for me. Gravel crunches beneath my boots as I move to the starting position. Oh,look, it is possible for my heart to beat faster . The damned thing practically flutters as I wipe my clammy palms on my leather pants. Rhiannon gets the rope into Tynan\u2019s hand, but instead of using it to swing to the next ball, he climbs\u2026 down . My jaw practically unhinges as he descends. Definitely didn\u2019 t see that one coming.",
  "\u201cViolet, begin!\u201d Emetterio orders. Be with me, Zihnal . I haven \u2019t spent nearly enough time at temple for the god of luck to care much abou t what happens to me right now, but it\u2019s worth a shot. I bolt up the first part of the ascent, coming to the spinning log within seconds. My stomach feels like it\u2019s being stirred by this balance beam from hell. \u201cIt\u2019s just balance. You can balance,\u201d I mumble and start across. \u201cQuick feet. Quick feet. Quick feet,\u201d I repeat all the way across, jumping off the end to land on the first of four granite columns, each one higher than the last. There are about three feet between them, but I manage to leap from one pillar to the next without skidding off the ends. And this is the easy part. A knot of fear works its way up my throat. I jump into the rotating wheel and run, leaping over the only opening as it flies by once, then watching it come around a second time. Timing. This one is all about timing.",
  "The opportunity comes and I seize it, racing through the opening and turning back onto the gravel path of the second ascent. The buoy balls are just ahead, but I\u2019m going to fall on my ass if I don\u2019t calm down and get my palms to stop sweating. Feathertail dragons are the breed we know the least about , I recite in my mind, needing every ounce of my lung capacity as I spring from the edge of the path onto the first ball, grasping it up top like Rhiannon did. The immediate strain on my shoulde rs makes me tense every muscle to keep thejoints from dislocating. Stay calm. Stay calm. Throwing my weight, I force the ball to rotate, swinging me toward the next one. This is because feathertails reportedly abhor violence and are not suitable for bonding. I repeat motions , grasping from one ball to the next, keeping my eyes on the chains and nothing else.",
  "Though this scholar cannot be certain, as one has never left the Vale within my lifetime. I contin ue reciting from memory as I reach the fifth and final ball. With one last swing, I throw myself sideways, releasing the ball and landing on the shoulder -wide gravel path without rolling an ankle. It\u2019s all momentum for the next ascent. \u201c Green dragons , \u201d I mutter under my breath , \u201c known for their keen intellect , descen d from the honorable Uaineloidsig line , and continue to be the most rational of dragonkind , making them the perfect siege weapons , especially in the case of clubtai ls. \u201d I finish as I line my body up with the first metal rod and get ready to sprint forward . \u201cAre you\u2026 studying ?\u201d Aure lie calls up from wher e she leaps onto the first ball below . \u201cCalms me down,\u201d I shoot back in quick explanation. There\u2019 s no time to be embarrassed here\u2014that can wait for later .",
  "There are three iron rails in front of me, each lined up like a battering ram toward the next. \u201cThe Scribe Quadrant is looking pretty good right now,\u201d I grumble under my breath, then launch myself toward the first. At least the texture gives me something to keep hold of as I work my way hand over hand. The ache in my shoulders grows into a throbbing pain when I reach the end of the first rail, swinging my feet to work up the momentum for the next. The first clang of iron as the rails meet makes my fingers slip, and I gasp as terror claws its way out of my stomach. Orange dragons, coming invarious shades of apricot to carr ot, ar e the most\u2014 I throw myself to the next rail\u2014 unpredictable of dragonkind and therefore always a risk. I move across the rail with the same hand-over -hand motion, ignoring the outright protests of my shoulders. Descending fr om the Fhaicorain line\u2014 My right hand loses purchase and my weight swings me into the face of the steep mountainside, my cheek slamming into the rock. A high-pitched ringing erupts in my ears and my vision darkens at the edges. \u201cViolet!\u201d Rhiannon shouts from the top. \u201cNext to you! The rope is next to you!\u201d Aurelie calls up.",
  "Iron scrapes my fingertips as my left hand slips, but I spot the rope and take hold, bracing my feet on the knot beneath me and clingin g tight until the ringing fades in my head. I have to swing over or climb down.",
  "I\u2019ve survived seven weeks in this damned quadrant, and this course isn\u2019t going to beat me today . Pushing off the edge, I swing out for the rail and make it, immediately starting the hand over hand to get me to the next one and then the next, until I finally let go, landing on the first shaking iron pillar . My brain is rattled as the thing shudders violently , and I leap to the next, barely gaining a foothold before jumping to the gravel path at the end of the ascent. Aurelie is right behind me, landing with a grin. \u201cThis is the best!\u201d \u201cYou clearly need to see the healers. You must have hit your head if you think this is fun.\u201d My breaths are choppy gasps, but I can\u2019t help but smile at her obvious joy . \u201cJust run straight across this one,\u201d she says as we reach the twisting staircase posts jutting straight from the side of the clif f face. Each three-foot- wide timber rotates from its base in one of the steepest sections of the course. I quickly calculate if you fall off one of the posts, you\u2019d probably drop at least thirty or forty feet onto the rocky terrain below . I swallo w down the terror trying to crawl up my throat and focus on the possibility my agility and lightness will give me an edge on this particularobstacle. She continues.",
  "\u201cT rust me. If you pause, it\u2019ll roll you right of f.\u201d I nod and bounc e on my feet, dredging up whatever courage I have left. Then I run. My feet are quick, making contact with each post only long enough to push off for the next, and within a few heartbeats, I\u2019m on the other side. \u201cYes!\u201d I shout, throwing my fist up in celebration as I get out of the way for Aurelie. \u201cGo, Violet!\u201d she shouts. \u201cHere I come!\u201d Her footwork is more agile than mine as she springs from spinning post to post. A roar sounds from overhead, and I jerk my gaze up just in time to see the underbelly of a Green Daggertail as it flies directly over us, headed back to the V ale.",
  "I\u2019m never going to get used to that. Aurelie cries out and my head snaps toward hers just in time to see her wobble and slip on the fifth post. The air freezes in my lungs as she careens forward, her belly hitting the next-to-last spinning log as if in slow motion. \u201cAurelie!\u201d I scream, lunging for her, my fingertips skimming the seventh post. Our eyes meet, shock and terro r filling her wide black eyes as the post rolls her away from me and she falls. Halfway down the clif f. \u2026 The sun burns my eyes as we stand in morning formation. \u201cCalvin Atwater ,\u201d Captain Fitzgibbons reads, his voice solemn like always. First Squad, Claw Section, Fourth Wing. He sits two rows behind me in Battle Brief. He sat . There\u2019 s nothing special about this morning. Our first trial on the Gauntlet has made the roll longer , but it\u2019s just another list on just another day\u2026except it\u2019s not. The exceptional cruelty of this ritual has never hit me this hard before. It\u2019s not like the first day anymore. I know more than half of the names as they\u2019re called. My vision blurs. \u201cNewland Jahvon,\u201d he continues. Second Squad, Flame Section, Fourth Wing. He had breakfast duty with me.",
  "We have to be in the twenties by now. How can this be all there is? We say their names once and then go on as if they never existed? Rhiannon shifts her weight at my side, and she abruptly sniffles, the motion jerking her shoulders once. \u201cAurelie Donans.\u201d A single tear escapes and I bat it away , ripping open one of the scabs along my cheek. A trickle of blood follows as the next name is called, but I let that one stain me. \u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Dain asks the next night, two worried lines between his brows as he clasps my shoulders. \u201cIf her parents aren\u2019 t coming to bury her body , then I should be the one to handle her things. I\u2019m the last person she saw,\u201d I explain, rolling my shoulders to adjust the weight of Aurelie\u2019 s pack. Every Basgiath parent has the same option when their cadet is killed. They can retrieve the body and personal effects for burial or burning or the school will put their body under a stone and burn their effects themselves. Aurelie\u2019 s parents have chosen door number two.",
  "\u201cAnd you don\u2019 t want me to go with you?\u201d he asks, palming my neck. I shake my head. \u201cI know where the burn pit is.\u201d He mutters a curse. \u201cI should have been there.\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019 t have done anything, Dain,\u201d I say softly , covering his hand with mine so our fingers lightly lace. \u201cNone of us could have. She didn\u2019 t even have time to reach for the rope,\u201d I whisper . I\u2019ve replayed that momentover and over in my head, coming to the same conclusion each time. \u201cI never got the chance to ask you if you made it all the way up,\u201d he says. I shake my head .",
  "\u201cI got caught at the chimney formation and had to use a rope to get back down. I\u2019m too short to span the distance, but I\u2019m not thinking about that tonight. I\u2019ll figure something out before the official timed Gauntlet on Presentation day .\u201d I\u2019ll have to. They don\u2019t allow cadets to climb back down on the final day. You either complete the Gauntlet\u2014or you fall to your death. \u201cAll right. Let me know if you need me.\u201d He lets me go. I nod and make every excuse to get out of the dormitory hallway. The weight of Aurel ie\u2019s pack is staggering. She was strong enough to carry so much over the parapet, and yet she fell. And I\u2019m somehow still standing. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m carrying her with me as I climb the stairs of the academic tower \u2019s turret, past the Battle Brief room and up to the stone roof, going by a few other cadets on their way down. The burn pit is nothing more than an extra-wide iron barrel, whose only purpose is to incinerate, and the flames burn bright against the night sky as I stumble out onto the roof, my lungs straining for oxygen.",
  "A couple of months ago, I couldn\u2019 t have carried a pack this heavy . There\u2019 s no one else up here as I slip the bag from my shoulder . \u201cI\u2019m so sorry ,\u201d I whisper , my fingers digging into the wide strap of the pack as I fling it up and over the metal edge of the bin.",
  "The flames catch and whoosh as it becomes more fuel for the fire, just another tribute to Malek, the god of death. Instead of walking back down the stairs, I make my way to the edge of the turre t. It\u2019s a cloudy night, but I can make out the shadows of three dragons as they approach from the west and even see the ridge where the Gauntlet lays, waiting to claim its next victim. It won\u2019 t be me .But why? Because I\u2019ll conque r it? Or because I\u2019ll give in to Dain\u2019 s request and hide in the Scribe Quadrant? My entire being repels against the second option, which makes me question everything as I stand here, letting minutes tick by before the bells sound for curfew . I climb back down the stairs without a solid answer as to why . I walk through the courtyard, empty but for a couple who can\u2019t decide if they\u2019d rather kiss or walk near the dais, and I avert my gaze, heading for the alcove where Dain and I first sat after Parapet. It\u2019s almost been two months, and I\u2019m still here. Still waki ng every morning to the sunrise. Doesn\u2019 t that mean something? Isn\u2019t there a chance, no matter how small, that I might just be enough to make it through Threshing? That I might just belong here?",
  "The door that leads to the tunnel we took to cross the ridgeline to the Gauntlet this morning opens along the courtyard wall, just left of the academic building, and my brow furrows. Who would be returning this late? Sitting back against the wall, I let the darkness conceal me as Xaden, Garrick, and Bodhi\u2014Xaden\u2019 s cousin\u2014pass under a mage light, headed in my direction. Three dragons . They were out\u2026doing what? There were no training ops that I know of tonight, not that I\u2019m privy to everything third-years do. \u201cThere has to be something more we can do,\u201d Bodhi argues, looking to Xaden, his voice low as they pass by me, their boots crunching on the gravel. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d Garrick hisses. My scalp prickle s and Xaden stops mid-step ten feet away , the set of his shoulders rigid. Shit. He knows I\u2019m here. Instead of the usual fear that spikes in his presence, only ange r rises inmy chest.",
  "If he wants to kill me, then fine. I\u2019m over waiting for it to happen. Over walking through the halls in fear . \u201cWhat\u2019 s wrong?\u201d Garrick asks, immediately looking over his shoulder in the opposite direction, toward the couple who definitely decided making out is more important than getting into the dorms by curfew . \u201cGo on. I\u2019ll meet you inside,\u201d Xaden says. \u201cYou sure?\u201d Bodhi\u2019 s forehead puckers, and his gaze sweeps over the courtyard. \u201cGo,\u201d Xaden orders, standing completely still until the other two walk into the barracks, turning left toward the stairwell that will take them to the second- and third-year floors. Only when they\u2019re gone does he turn and face the exact spot where I\u2019m sitting. \u201cI know you know I\u2019m here.\u201d I force myself to stand and move toward him so he doesn\u2019 t think I\u2019m hiding or worse\u2014scared of him. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t prattle on about commanding the dark. I\u2019m not in the mood tonight.\u201d \u201cNo questions about where I\u2019ve been?\u201d He folds his arms across his chest and studies me in the moonlight. His scar looks even more mena cing in this light, but I can\u2019 t seem to find the ener gy to be scared. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t care.\u201d I shrug, the movement making the throb in my shoulders intensify .",
  "Awesome, just in time to practice on the Gauntlet tomorr ow. He cocks his head to the side. \u201cY ou really don\u2019 t, do you?\u201d \u201cNope. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not out after curfew myself.\u201d A heavy sigh blows through my lips. \u201cWhat are you doing out after curfew , first-year?\u201d \u201cDebating runni ng away ,\u201d I retort. \u201cHow about you? Feel like sharing?\u201d I ask mockingly , knowing he\u2019 s not about to answer me. \u201cThe same.\u201d Sarcastic ass. \u201cLook, are you going to kill me or not? The anticipation is starting toannoy the fuck out of me.\u201d I lift a hand to my shoulder and roll it, pressing in on the sore muscles, but it doesn\u2019 t help the ache. \u201cHaven\u2019 t decided yet,\u201d he answers, like I\u2019ve just inquired about his dinner preferences, but his gaze narrows on my cheek. \u201cWell, could you?\u201d I mutter . \u201cIt would definitely help me make my plans for the week.\u201d Markham or Emetterio.",
  "Scribe or rider . \u201cAm I affecting your schedule, Violence?\u201d There\u2019 s a definite smirk on those lips. \u201cI just need to know what my chances are here.\u201d My hands curl into fists. The ass has the nerve to smile. \u201cThat\u2019 s the oddest way I\u2019ve ever been hit on\u2014\u201d \u201cNot my chances with you, you conceited prick!\u201d Fuck this. Fuck all of this. I move past him, but he catches my wrist, his grip light but his hold firm. His fingertips on my pulse make it skitter . \u201cChances at what?\u201d he asks, tugging me just close enough that my shoulder brushes his biceps. \u201cNothing.\u201d He wouldn\u2019 t unders tand. He\u2019s a damned wingleader , which means he\u2019s excelled at everything in the quadrant, even somehow managing to get past his own last name.",
  "\u201cChances at what ?\u201d he repeats. \u201cDo not make me ask three times.\u201d His ominous tone is at odds with his gentle grasp, and shit, does he have to smell so good? Like mint and leather and something I can\u2019t quite identify , something that borders between citrus and floral. \u201cAt living through all of this! I can\u2019t make it up the damned Gauntlet.\u201d I half-heartedly tug at my wrist, but he doesn\u2019 t let go. \u201cI see.\u201d He\u2019s so infuriatingly calm, and I can\u2019t even get a grip on one of my emotions. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re probably celebrating because I\u2019ll fall to my death and you won\u2019 t have to go to the trouble of killing me.\u201d\u201cKilling you wouldn\u2019 t be any trouble, Violence. It\u2019s leaving you alive that seems to cause the majority of my trouble.\u201d My gaze swings up to clash with his, but his face is unreadable, cloaked in shadow , go figure. \u201cSorry to be a hassle.\u201d Sarcasm drips from my voice. \u201cYou know the problem with this place?\u201d I tug my arm back again, but he holds fast. \u201cBesides you touching things that don\u2019t belong to you?\u201d My eyes narrow on him. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to tell me.\u201d My stomach flutters as his thumb brushes my pulse and he releases my wrist.",
  "I answer before I can think better of it. \u201cHope.\u201d \u201cHope?\u201d He tips his head closer to mine, as if he wasn\u2019 t sure he heard me right. \u201cHope.\u201d I nod. \u201cSomeone like you would never get it, but I knew coming here was a death sentence. It didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019ve been trained my entire life to enter the Scribe Quadrant; when General Sorrengail gives an order , you can\u2019t exactl y ignore it.\u201d Gods, why am I running off at the mouth to this man? What\u2019 s the worst he\u2019ll do? Kill you? \u201cSure you can.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cY ou just might not like the consequences.\u201d I roll my eyes, and to my utter embarrassment, instead of pulling away now that I\u2019m free, I lean in just a little, like I can siphon off some of his strength. He certainly has enough to spare. \u201cI knew what the odds were, and I came anyway , concentrating on that tiny percentage of a chance that I would live. And then I make it almost two months and I get\u2026\u201d I shake my head, clenching my jaw. \u201cHopeful.\u201d The word tastes sour . \u201cAh.",
  "And then you lose a squadmate, and you can\u2019t quite get up the chimney , and you give up. I\u2019m starting to see. It\u2019s not a flattering picture, but if you want to run of f to the Scribe Quadrant\u2014\u201d I gasp, fear punching a hole in my stomach.",
  "\u201cHow do you know aboutthat?\u201d If he knows\u2026if he tells, Dain is in danger .

He who does not burn for Malek will be burned by Malek. \u2014M AJOR RORILEE \u2019S GUIDE TO APPEASING THE GODS, SECOND EDITION CHAPTER ELEVEN The next practice sessions of the Gauntlet are no more successful than my first, but at least we don\u2019t lose another squadmate. Tynan has quit running his mouth, since he can\u2019 t seem to make it up fully , either . The buoy balls are his downfall. The chimney is mine. By the ninth\u2014 and next-to-last\u2014session, I\u2019m ready to set the entire obstacle course on fire. The section of the course that\u2019s my downfall is meant to simulate the strength and agility it takes to mount a dragon, and it\u2019s becoming clear that my size is going to fuck me. \u201cMaybe you can climb up onto my shoulders and then\u2026\u201d Rhiannon shakes her head as we study the crevice that\u2019 s become my nemesis. \u201cThen I\u2019m still stuck halfway up,\u201d I answer , wiping the sweat from my forehead.",
  "\u201cDoesn\u2019 t matter . You can\u2019t touch another cadet on the route.\u201d Sawyer folds his arms beside me, the tip of his nose now bright red from the high sun. \u201cAre you here to squash hopes and dreams, or do you have a suggestion?\u201d Rhiannon retorts. \u201cBecause Presentation is tomorrow , so ifyou\u2019ve got any bright ideas, now is the time.\u201d If I\u2019m going to run to the Scrib e Quadrant, then tonight is the night. My heart clenches against the thought. It\u2019 s the logical choice. The safe choice. There are only two thoughts stopping me. One, there\u2019s no guarantee my mother won\u2019 t find out. Just because Markham would keep quiet doesn\u2019 t mean the instructors there will. But most importantly , if I go, if I hide\u2026I\u2019ll never know if I\u2019m good enough to make it here. And while I might not survive if I stay, I\u2019m not sure I can live with myself if I leave. \u2026 \u201cDoria Merrill,\u201d Captain Fitzgibbons says from the dais. Every one of his features is crystal clear , not only because the sun is behind the shade of the clouds but because I\u2019m closer .",
  "Our formation gets tighter with every cadet who falls. According to Brennan and statistics, today will be one of the deadliest for first-years. It\u2019s Presentation Day, and in order to get to the flight field, we\u2019ll have to climb the Gauntlet first. Everything about the Riders Quadrant is designed to weed out the weak, and today is no exception. \u201cKamryn Dyre.\u201d Captain Fitzgibbons continues to read from the roll.",
  "I flinch. His seat was across from mine in Dragonkind. \u201cArvel Pelipa.\u201d Imogen and Quinn\u2014both secon d-years\u2014suck in a breath ahead of me. First-years aren\u2019 t the only ones at risk; we\u2019re just the most likely to die. \u201cMichel Iverem.\u201d Captain Fitzgibbons closes the roll. \u201cWe commend their souls to Malek.\u201d And with that final word, formation breaks. \u201cSecond- and third-years, unless you\u2019re on Gauntlet duty, head to class. First-years, it\u2019s time to show us what you\u2019ve got.\u201d Dain forces a smile and skips right over me as he looks at our squad.\u201cGood luck today .\u201d Imogen tucks an errant strand of pink hair behind her ear and aims a sickly-sweet smile right at me. \u201cHopefully you won\u2019 t fall\u2026 short.\u201d \u201cSee you later ,\u201d I reply , lifting my chin. She stares at me with complete loathing for a second, then walks off with Quinn and Cianna, our executi ve officer, her shoulder -length blond curls bouncing. \u201cBest of luck.\u201d Heaton\u2014the thickest third-year in our squad, with red flames cut and dyed into their hair\u2014taps their heart, right over two of their patches, and offers us all a genuine but flat-lipped smile before heading to class.",
  "As I stare at their retreating back, I wonder what the circular patch on their upper right arm with water and floating spheres means. I know the triangular patch to the left of that one, with the longsword, means they\u2019re not to be messed with on the mat. Since Dain told me abou t the patch denoting his top secret signet, I\u2019ve been paying close atten tion to the patches other cadets have sewn into their uniforms. Most wear them like badges of honor , but I recognize them for what they really are\u2014intelligence that I might one day need to defeat them. \u201cI didn\u2019 t realize Heaton actually knew how to speak.\u201d Two lines appear between Ridoc\u2019 s brows. \u201cMaybe they figure they should at least say hi before we\u2019re potentially roasted today ,\u201d Rhiannon says.",
  "\u201cBack into formation,\u201d Dain orders. \u201cAre you going with us?\u201d I ask. He nods, still not looking at me. The eight of us fall into two lines of four, the same as the other squads around us. \u201cAwkward,\u201d Rhiannon whispers from my side. \u201cHe seems kind of pissed at you.\u201dI glance up over Trina\u2019s slim shoulders as the breeze whips at the braid I\u2019ve woven like a crown. It\u2019s working a few of Trina\u2019s ringlet curls loose, too. \u201cHe wants something I can\u2019 t give him.\u201d Her eyebrows rise. I roll my eyes. \u201cNot like\u2026that.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019 t care if it was like that,\u201d she replies under her breath. \u201cHe\u2019 s hot. He has that whole boy-next-door -who-can-still-kick-your -ass vibe going for him.\u201d I fight a smile because she\u2019 s right. He so does. \u201cWe\u2019re the biggest squad,\u201d Ridoc notes behind us as the squads farthest left\u2014from First W ing\u2014file out through the western gate in the courtyard. \u201cWhat are we down to?\u201d T ynan asks. \u201cHundred and eighty?\u201d \u201cHundred and seventy-one,\u201d Dain answers. Squads from Second Wing begin to move, led by their wingleader , which means Xaden is somewhere ahead of us.",
  "My nerves are reserved for the obstacle course, but I can\u2019t help but wonder which way his scales will tip today . \u201cFor a hundred dragons? But what will we\u2026\u201d Trina asks, nerves cutting off her words. \u201cStop letting fear leach into your voice,\u201d Luca snaps from behind Rhiannon. \u201cIf the dragons think you\u2019re a coward, you\u2019ll be nothing but a name tomorrow .\u201d \u201cShe says,\u201d Ridoc narrates, \u201cinducing more fear .\u201d \u201cShut up,\u201d Luca fires back. \u201cY ou know it\u2019 s true.\u201d \u201cJust portray confidence, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I lean forward so our squadmates behind us can\u2019t hear me as Third Wing begins to march for the gate. \u201cThanks,\u201d T rina whispers in reply . Dain\u2019 s narrowed gaze finally locks on mine, but at least he doesn\u2019t call me a liar. There\u2019 s enough accusa tion in his eyes that I might as well be triedand convicted of it, though. \u201cNervous, Rhi?\u201d I ask, knowing we\u2019re about to be called next. \u201cFor you?\u201d she asks. \u201cNot at all.",
  "W e\u2019ve got this.\u201d \u201cOh, I meant about the history test tomorrow ,\u201d I tease. \u201cThere\u2019 s nothing going on today to panic about.\u201d \u201cNow that you mention it, the whole Treaty of Arif might just be the death of me.\u201d She grins. \u201cAhh, the agreement between Navarre and Krovla for mutually shared airspace for both dragons and gryphons over a narrow strip of the Esben Mountains, between Sumerton and Draithus,\u201d I recall, nodding. \u201cYour memory is terrifying.\u201d She shoots me a smile. But my memory isn\u2019 t going to get me up the Gauntlet. \u201cFourth Wing!\u201d Xaden calls out from somewhere in the distanc e. I don\u2019t even need to see to know that it\u2019s him who gave the order and not his executive of ficer. \u201cMove out!\u201d We file of f, Flame Section, then Claw , and finally T ail. There\u2019 s a bit of a bottleneck at the gate, but then we\u2019re through , walking into the mage-lit dimness of the tunnel that we take every morning to reach the Gauntlet. Shadows blanket the edges of the rocky floor along our path.",
  "What are the limits of Xaden\u2019 s power anyway? Could he use shadows to choke out every squad in here? Would he need to rest or recharge after? Does such a vast power come with any sort of checks or balances? Dain falls back so he walks between Rhiannon and me. \u201cChange your mind.\u201d It\u2019 s barely a whisper . \u201cNo.\u201d I sound way more confident than I feel. \u201cChange. Your. Mind.\u201d His hand finds mine, concealed by our tight formation as we descend through the passage. \u201cPlease.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cAny more than you would leave Cath and run to the scribes yourself.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s differen t.\u201d His hand squeezes mine, and I can feel the tension inhis fingers, his arm. \u201cI\u2019m a rider .\u201d \u201cWell, maybe I am, too,\u201d I whisper as light appears ahead. I didn\u2019 t believe it before , not when I couldn\u2019 t leave because my mother wouldn\u2019 t let me, but now I have a choice. And I choose to stay . \u201cDon\u2019 t be\u2014\u201d He cuts himself off and drops my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bury you, V i.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that one of us will have to bury the other .\u201d It\u2019s not macabre, just fact.",
  "\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d The light grows into an archwa y that\u2019s ten feet high, leading us to the base of the Gauntlet. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this,\u201d Dain begs, not bothering to lower his voice this time as we emer ge into the mottled sunlight. The view is spectacular as always. We\u2019re still high on the mountain, thousands of feet above the valley , and the greenery seems to stretch endlessly to the south, with random clusters of squat trees among colorful slopes of wildflowers. My gaze turns to the Gauntlet carved into the face of the cliff, and I can\u2019t help but follow each obstacle higher and higher until I\u2019m staring at the top of the ridgeline that the maps I\u2019ve studied show leads into a box canyon\u2014the flight field. I bite my lip as I stare at the break in the tree line. Normally , only riders are allowed on the flight field\u2014except for Presentation.",
  "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can watch,\u201d Dain says, drawing my attention back to his stron g face. His perfectly trimmed beard brackets full lips drawn tight into a frown. \u201cThen close your eyes.\u201d I have a plan\u2014a shitty one, but it\u2019 s worth a try . \u201cWhat changed between Parapet and now?\u201d Dain asks again, a wealth of emotions in his eyes that I can\u2019t begin to interpret. Well, except the fear. That doesn\u2019 t need any interpretation.\u201cMe.\u201d \u2026 An hour later, my feet fly over the spinning posts of the staircase, and I jump to the safety of the gravel path. Third ascent complete. Two more to go. And I haven\u2019 t touched a single rope. I swear I can feel Dain staring from the bottom of the course, where Tynan and Luca have yet to start their climb, but I don\u2019t look down. There\u2019 s no time for what he thinks will be one last look, and I can\u2019t afford the delay of comforting him when there are still two obstacles ahead of me. Which means there\u2019 s one I haven\u2019 t even had the chance to practice\u2014the nearly vertical ramp at the end. \u201cYou can do it!\u201d Rhiannon yells from the top as I reach the chimney structure. \u201cOr you can do us all a favor and fall!\u201d another voice yells.",
  "Jack, no doubt. At least it\u2019s only been our squad at practice sessions, but every first- year can watch now, either from the base of the course or the edges of the cliff above. I look up at the hollow column I\u2019m supposed to climb, then dart back a few feet along the path. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Rhiannon shouts as I grab one of the ropes and drag it horizonta lly across the surface of the cliff, sending pebb les into free fall. It\u2019s heavy as hell and protests the stretch, but I manage to get the bottom portion onto the chimney structure. Pulling the rope as tight as it can go, I plant one foot on the side of the shaft and give the rope a tug, then send up a prayer to Zihnal that this is going to work.",
  "\u201cCan she do that?\u201d someone snaps. I\u2019m doing it now . Then I lift my other foot and begin to climb up the chimney , using onlythe right side, walking up stone and leveraging my weight with the rope, hand over hand. The line slips about halfway up as the rope scrapes over a large boulder , but I quickly take up the slack and keep climbing. My heart thunders in my ears, but it\u2019s my hands that are killing me. It feels like flames are eating my palms, and I grit my teeth so I don\u2019 t cry out. There it is. The top. The rope barely cuts the corner of the structure now, and I use what\u2019 s left of my upper-body strength to pull myself up, scrambling to my hands and knees on the path. \u201cHell yes!\u201d Ridoc yells, hooting from the top. \u201cThat\u2019 s our girl!\u201d \u201cGet up!\u201d Rhiannon shouts. \u201cOne more!\u201d My chest heaves and my lungs ache, but I make it to my feet. I\u2019m on the last ascent, the final path to the flight field, and standing in front of me is a ramp made of wood that juts out ten feet from the cliff wall, then curves upward like the inside of a bowl, the highest point level with the cliff top ten feet above.",
  "The obstacle is meant to test a cadet\u2019 s ability to scale a dragon \u2019s foreleg and reach its saddle. And I\u2019m too short. But Xaden\u2019s words that the right way wasn\u2019 t the only way have played over and over in my head all night long. By the time the sun rose and chased away the darkness, I had a plan. I only hope I can actually pull it of f. I unshea the my largest dagger from home and wipe away the sweat on my forehead with the back of my dirty palm. Then I forget the agony in my hands, the throb bing of my shoulders, and the twinge in my knee from landing wrong after the pillars. I block out all the pain, lock it behind a wall like I\u2019ve done my entire life, and focus on the ramp as though my life depends on making it.",
  "There\u2019 s no rope here. There\u2019 s only one way I\u2019m getting over this. Sheer fucking will.And so I char ge, using my speed to my advantage. There\u2019 s a drumlike sound as my feet beat against the ramp and the incline sharpens. Just because I haven\u2019 t personally conquered this obstacle doesn\u2019 t mean I haven\u2019 t watched my squadmates take it over and over again. I throw my body forward and momentum carries me upward, running up the side of the ramp. I wait until I feel the precious shift, the moment gravity reclaims my body almost two feet from the top, and I swing my arm up and slam my dagger into the slick, soft wood of the ramp\u2014and use it to fling myself the last foot upward. A primal scream rips from my throat as my shoulder cries in protest just as my fingers graze the lip of the edge. I throw my elbow over the top to gain more lever age and pull myself up and over, using the handle of my dagger as a final step before lurching onto the top of the clif f. Not done yet . On my stomach, I turn to face the ramp, then reach over the side and yank my dagger free, sheathing it at my ribs before I stagger to my feet. I made it.",
  "Relief sucks the adrenaline straight out of my body . Rhiannon\u2019 s arms sweep around me, taking my weight as I gasp for air. Ridoc hugs my back, squeezing me like I\u2019m the filling of a sandwich as he hollers in happin ess. I\u2019d protest, but right now they\u2019re all that\u2019s keeping me upright. \u201cShe can\u2019 t do that!\u201d someone shouts. \u201cYeah, well, she just did!\u201d Rido c tosses over his shoulder , loosening his grip on me. My knees shake, but they hold as I suck in breath after breath. \u201cYou made it!\u201d Rhiannon takes my face in her hands, tears filling her brown eyes. \u201cY ou made it!\u201d \u201cLuck.\u201d I draw in another breath and beg my galloping heart to slow.",
  "\u201cAnd. Adrenaline.\u201d\u201cCheating!\u201d I turn toward the voice. It\u2019s Amber Mavis, the strawberry-blond wingleader from Third Wing who was Dain\u2019 s close friend last year, and there\u2019 s nothing but fury on her face as she charges toward Xaden, who\u2019 s only a couple of feet away with the roll, recording times with a stopwatch and looking rather bored with it all. \u201cBack the hell up, Mavis,\u201d Garrick threatens, the sun flashing off the two swords the curly -haired section leader keeps strapped to his back as he puts his body between Amber and Xaden. \u201cThe cheater clearly used foreig n materials not once but twice ,\u201d Amber yells. \u201cIt\u2019 s not to be tolerated! W e live by the rules or we die by them!\u201d No wonder she and Dain are so close\u2014they\u2019re both in love with the Codex. \u201cI don\u2019t take kindly to calling anyone in my section a cheater ,\u201d Garrick warns, his massi ve shoulders blocking her from view as he turns. \u201cAnd my wingleader will handle any rule-breaking in his own wing.\u201d He moves to the side, and I\u2019m met with Amber \u2019s glaring blue eyes. \u201cSorrengail?\u201d Xaden asks, arching an eyebrow in obvious challenge, a pen poised over the book.",
  "I notice not for the first time that other than his Fourth Wing and wingleader emblems, he doesn\u2019 t wear the patches others are so fond of displaying. \u201cI expect the thirty-second penalty for using the rope,\u201d I answer, my breaths steadying. \u201cAnd the knife?\u201d Amber \u2019s gaze narrows. \u201cShe\u2019 s disqualified.\u201d When Xaden doesn\u2019 t answer , she turns that glare on him. \u201cSurely she\u2019s out!",
  "You can\u2019t tolerate lawlessness within your own wing, Riorson!\u201d But Xaden\u2019 s gaze never leave s mine as he silently waits for me to respond. \u201cA rider may only bring to the quadrant the items they can carry\u2014\u201d I start.\u201cAre you quoting the Codex to me?\u201d Amber shouts. \u201c\u2014and they shall not be separat ed from those items no matter what they may be,\u201d I continue. \u201cFor once carried across the parapet, they are considered part of their person. Article Three, Section Six, Addendum B.\u201d Her blue eyes flare wide as I glance at her. \u201cThat addendum was written to make thievery an executional of fense.\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d I nod, looking betwe en her and the onyx eyes that see straight through me. \u201cBut in doing so, it gave any item carried across the parapet the status of being a part of the rider.\u201d I unsheathe the chipped and battered blade with a sharp bite of pain in my palms. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge blade. It\u2019s one I carried across and therefore considered part of myself.\u201d His eyes flare, and I don\u2019t miss the hint of a smirk on that infuriatingly decadent mouth of his. It should be against the Codex to look that good and be so ruthless. \u201cThe right way isn\u2019 t the only way .\u201d I use his own words against him.",
  "Xaden holds my gaze. \u201cShe has you, Amber .\u201d \u201cOn a technicality!\u201d \u201cShe still has you.\u201d He turns slightly and delivers a look that I never want directed at me. \u201cYou think like a scribe,\u201d she barks at me. It\u2019s intended as an insult, but I just nod. \u201cI know .\u201d She marches off, and I sheathe the dagger again, letting my hands fall to my sides and closing my eyes as relief shucks the weight from my shoulders. I did it. I passed another test. \u201cSorrengail,\u201d Xaden says, and my eyes fly open. \u201cYou\u2019re leaking.\u201d His gaze drops pointedly to my hands. Where blood is dripping from my fingertips. Pain erupts, pushing past my mental dam like a raging river at the sight of the mess I\u2019ve made of my palms. I\u2019ve shredded them. \u201cDo something about it,\u201d he orders.I nod and back away , joining my squad. Rhiannon helps me cut off the sleeves of my shirt to banda ge my hands, and I cheer our last two squadmates up the clif f. We all make it.Presentation Day is unlike any other .",
  "The air is ripe with possibilities, and possibly the stench of sulfur fr om a dragon who has been offended. Never look a r ed in the eye. Never back down from a gr een. If you show tr epidation to a br own\u2026well, just don\u2019t. \u2014C OLONEL KAORI\u2019S FIELD GUIDE TO DRAGONKIND CHAPTER TWELVE There are 169 of us by the time the morning is done and, even with my penalty for the rope, we\u2019ve placed eleventh out of the thirty-six squads for Presentation\u2014the piss-inducing parade of cadets before this year\u2019s dragons willing to bond. Anxiety seizes my legs at the thought of walking so close to dragons determined to weed out the weak before Threshing, and I suddenly wish we\u2019d placed last. The fastest up the Gauntlet was Liam Mairi, of course, earning him the Gauntlet patch. Pretty sure that guy doesn\u2019 t know how to take second place, but I wasn\u2019 t the slowest, and that\u2019 s good enough for me.",
  "The box canyon that makes up the training field is spectacu lar in the afternoon sun, with miles of autumn-colored meadows and peaks rising on three sides of us as we wait at the narrowest part, the entrance to the valley . At the end, I can make out the line of the waterfall that might be just a trickle of a creek now but will rush at runof f season. The leaves of the trees are all turning gold, as though someone has brought in a paintbrush with only one color and streaked it across the landscape. And then there are the dragons.Averaging twent y-five feet tall, they\u2019re in a formation of their own, lined up sever al feet back from the path\u2014close enough to pass judgment on us as we walk by . \u201cLet\u2019 s go, Second Squad, you\u2019re up next,\u201d Garrick says, beckoning us with a wave that makes the rebellion relic on his bared forearm gleam. Dain and the other squad leade rs stayed behind. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll be thrilled I made it up the Gauntlet or disappointed that I bent the rules. But I\u2019ve never felt more thrilled.",
  "\u201cInto formation ,\u201d Garrick orders, his tone all business, whic h doesn\u2019 t surprise me given that his leadership style is more mission first, niceties last. Go figure he seems to be so close to Xaden. Unlike Xaden, though, the right side of his uniform has a neat line of patches proclaiming him Flame\u2019 s section leader as well as more than five patches advertising his skill with a multitude of weapons. We comply , and Rhiannon and I end up near the back this time. There\u2019 s a sound like rushing wind in the distance that stops as quickly as it starts, and I know someone else has been found lacking. Garrick\u2019 s hazel eyes skim over us. \u201cHopefully Aetos has done his job, so you know that it\u2019s a straight walk down the meadow .",
  "I\u2019d recommend staying at least seven feet apart\u2014\u201d \u201cIn case one of us gets torched,\u201d Ridoc mutters from ahead. \u201cCorrect, Ridoc. Cluster if you want, just know if a dragon finds disfavor with one of you, it\u2019s likely to burn the whole lot to weed one out,\u201d Garrick warns, holding our gazes for a beat. \u201cAlso, remember you\u2019re not here to approach them, and if you do, you won\u2019 t be making it back to the dormitory tonight.\u201d \u201cCan I ask a question?\u201d Luca says from the front row . Garrick nods, but the ticking of his jaw says he\u2019s annoyed. I can\u2019t blame him. Luca annoys the shit out of me, too.",
  "It\u2019s her constant need to tear everyone down that makes most of us keep our distance.\u201cThird Squad, Tail Section of Fourth Wing already went through, and I talked to some of the cadets\u2026\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s not a question.\u201d He lifts his brows. Yep, he\u2019 s annoyed. \u201cRight. It\u2019s just that they said there\u2019 s a feathertail?\u201d Her voice pitches upward. \u201cA f-feathertail?\u201d Tynan sputter s from directly in front of me. \u201cWho the hell would ever want to bond a feathertail?\u201d I roll my eyes, and Rhiannon shakes her head. \u201cProfessor Kaor i never told us there would be a feathertail,\u201d Sawyer says. \u201cI know because I memorized every single dragon he showed us. All hundred of them.\u201d \u201cWell, guess there\u2019 s a hundred and one now,\u201d Garrick replies, looking at us as if we\u2019re children he\u2019d like to be rid of before glancing back over his shoulder at the entrance to the valley . \u201cRelax. Feathertails don\u2019t bond. I can\u2019t even remember the last time one has been seen outside the Vale.",
  "It\u2019s probably just curious. You\u2019re up. Stay on the path. You walk up, you wait for the entire squad, you walk back down. It really doesn\u2019 t get any easier than this from here on out, kids, so if you can\u2019t follow those simple instructions, then you deserve whatever happens in there.\u201d He turns and heads over to a path before the canyon wall where the dragons are perched. We follow , breaking away from the crowd of first-years. The breeze bites at my bare shoulders from where we ripped my sleeves for bandages, but we got the blood flow stopped at my hands. \u201cThey\u2019re all yours,\u201d Garrick says to the quadrant\u2019 s senior wingleader , a woman I\u2019ve seen a few times in Battle Brief murmuring to Xaden. Her uniform still has her signature spikes on the shoulders, but this time they\u2019re gold and look sharp as hell\u2014like she wanted to throw in a little extra badass today . She nods and dismisses him. \u201cSingle file.\u201dWe all shuffle into a line. Rhiannon is at my back and Tynan just ahead of me, which means I\u2019ll be treated to his commentary the whole time, no doubt. Awesome .",
  "\u201cTalk,\u201d the senior wingleader says, folding her arms across her chest. \u201cNice day for a Presentation,\u201d Ridoc jokes. \u201cNot to me.\u201d The senior wingleader narrows her gaze on Ridoc, then motions to the line of cadets before her. \u201cTalk to your nearby squadmates while you\u2019re on the path, as it will help the dragons get a sense of who you are and how well you play with others. There\u2019 s a correlati on between bonded cadets and level of chatter .\u201d And now I want to switch places. \u201cFeel free to look at the dragon s, especially if they\u2019re showing off their tails, but I would abstain from eye contact if you value your life.",
  "If you come across a scorch mark , just make sure nothing \u2019 s currently on fire before continuing along. \u201d She pauses long enough for that bit of advice to sink in , then adds , \u201c See you after your stroll. \u201d With a sweep of her hand , the senior wingleader steps to the side , revealing the dirt path that leads through the center of the valley , and up ahead , sitting so perfectly still that they might be gargoyles , are the hundred and one dragons who have decided to bond this year .",
  "The line starts, and we give one another the suggested seven feet before following. I\u2019m hyperaware of every step as I walk down the path. The trail is hard beneath my boots, and there\u2019 s a definite lingering odor of sulfur . We pass a trio of red dragons first. Their talons are almost half my size. \u201cI can\u2019t even see their tails!\u201d Tynan shouts from in front of me. \u201cHow are we supposed to know what breed they are?\u201d I keep my eyes locked at the level of their massive, muscled shoulders as we walk by . \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to know what breed they are,\u201d I respond.",
  "\u201cFuck that,\u201d he says over his shoulder . \u201cI need to figure out which oneI\u2019m going to approach during Threshing.\u201d \u201cPretty sure this little walk is so they can decide,\u201d I retort. \u201cHopefully one of them will decide you don\u2019t get to make it to Threshing,\u201d Rhiannon says, her voice quiet so it barely reaches me. I laugh as we approach a set of browns, both slightly smaller than my mother \u2019s Aimsir , but not by much. \u201cThey\u2019re a little bigger than I thought they would be,\u201d Rhiannon says, her voice rising. \u201cNot that I didn\u2019 t see the ones at Parapet, but\u2026\u201d I look over my shoulder to see her wide gaze flickering betwee n the path and the dragons. She\u2019 s nervous. \u201cSo do you know if you\u2019re having a niece or nephew?\u201d I ask, continuing to walk forward past a handful of oranges. \u201cWhat?\u201d she answers. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some of the healer s can make pretty good guesse s once a woman is further along in her pregnancy .\u201d \u201cOh. No,\u201d she says. \u201cNo clue. Though I\u2019m kind of hoping she\u2019ll have a girl.",
  "I guess I\u2019ll find out once we finish the year and can write our families.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s a bullshit rule,\u201d I say over my shoulder , lowering my gaze immediately when I accidentally make eye contact with one of the oranges. Breathe normally . Swallow the fear. Fear and weakn ess will get me killed, and since I\u2019m already bleeding, the odds aren\u2019 t exactly in my favor here. \u201cYou don\u2019 t think it encourages loyalty to the wing?\u201d Rhiannon asks. \u201cI think I\u2019m just as loyal to my sister whether I\u2019ve had a letter from her or not,\u201d I counter . \u201cThere are bonds that can\u2019 t be broken.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d be loyal to your sister , too,\u201d Tynan says, turning around and grinning as he walks backward. \u201cShe\u2019 s one hell of a rider, and that ass. I saw her right before Parapet and damn, V iolet. She\u2019 s hot.\u201d We pass by another set of reds, then a single brown and a pair of greens. \u201cTurn around.\u201d I make the spinning motion with my finger . \u201cMira would eat you for breakfast, T ynan.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just wonde ring how one of you got all the good traits and the other looks like she got the leftovers.\u201d His gaze skims down my body . Full-body-shudder gross.",
  "\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d I flip him the middle finger . \u201cJust saying, maybe I\u2019ll write a letter of my own once we get privileges.\u201d He turns and continues walking. \u201cA nephew would be good,\u201d Rhiannon says, like the conversation was never interrupted. \u201cBoys aren\u2019 t too bad.\u201d \u201cMy brother was awesome, but he and Dain are my only experi ence with growing up around little boys.\u201d We pass more dragons, and my breathing starts to settle. The smell of sulfur disappears, or maybe I\u2019ve just grown accustomed to it. They\u2019re close enough to torch us, the half dozen singe marks testify to that, but I can\u2019t hear them breathing or feel it, either . \u201cThough I think Dain was probably a little more rule-abiding than most kids. He likes order and pretty much detests anything that doesn\u2019 t fit neatly into his plan. He\u2019s probably going to give me shit about how I got up the Gauntlet, just like Amber Mavis did.\u201d We pass the halfway mark and continue. Is the way the dragons stare at us scary as hell? Absolutely , but they want to be here the same as we do, so at least I hope they\u2019ll be judicious with their firepower .",
  "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about the rope plan? Or the dagger?\u201d Rhiannon asks, hurt pitching her tone. \u201cY ou can trust me, you know .\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019 t think of it until yesterday ,\u201d I answer , taking the time to look over my shoulder so I can see her. \u201cAnd if it didn\u2019 t work, I didn\u2019 t want you to be an accom plice. You have a real future here, and I refuse to bring you down with me if I didn\u2019 t make it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019 t need you to protect me.\u201d \u201cI know . But it\u2019s just what friends do, Rhi.\u201d I shrug as we walk by a trio of brow ns, the soft crunch of our boots on the dark gravel path the onlysound for a few minutes. \u201cYou keeping any other secrets up there?\u201d Rhiannon eventually asks. Guilt settles in my stomach when I think of Xaden and his meeting with the other marked ones. \u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to know everything there is to know about someone.\u201d I feel like shit but keep from lying, at least.",
  "She snorts a laugh. \u201cIf that wasn\u2019 t skirting the question. How about this? Promise me that if you need help, you\u2019ll let me give it to you.\u201d A smile spreads across my face despite the terrifying greens we\u2019re walking by. \u201cHow about this,\u201d I toss over my shoulder . \u201cI promise that if I need help you\u2019re capable of giving, I\u2019ll ask, but only\u201d\u2014I hold up my forefinger\u2014\u201cif you promise the same.\u201d \u201cDeal.\u201d She smiles wide. \u201cYou guys done bonding back there?\u201d Tynan sneers. \u201cBecause we\u2019re almost to the end of the line, if you haven\u2019 t noticed.\u201d He pauses in the middle of the path, his gaze swinging right.",
  "\u201cAnd I still can\u2019t figure out which one I\u2019m going to choose.\u201d \u201cWith arrogance like that, I\u2019m sure any dragon would feel lucky to share your mind for the rest of your life.\u201d I pity whatever dragon\u2014if any\u2014 chooses him. The rest of the squad is gathered ahead of us, facing our direct ion at the end of the path, but all their attention is focused to the right. We pass the last brown dragon, and I inhale sharply . \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d T ynan stares. \u201cKeep walking,\u201d I order , but my gaze is transfixed. Standing at the end of the line is a small golden dragon. Sunlight reflects off its scales and horns as it stands to its full height, flicking a feathered tail around the side of its body . The feathertail. My jaw drops as I take in the sharp teeth and quick, darting movements of its head as it studies us. At its full height, it\u2019s probably only a few feet taller than I am, like a perfect miniature of the brown next to it.I walk straight into Tynan\u2019 s back and startle. We\u2019ve reached the end of the path, where the rest of the squad has been waiting. \u201cGet off me, Sorrengail,\u201d Tynan hisses and shoves me back. \u201cWho the hell would bond that thing?\u201d My chest tightens.",
  "\u201cThey can hear you,\u201d I remind him. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking yellow .\u201d Luca points right at the dragon, disgust curling her lip. \u201cSo not only is it obviously too small to carry a rider in battle, but it\u2019s not even powerful enough to be a real color .\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019 s a mistake,\u201d Sawyer says quietly . \u201cMaybe it\u2019 s a baby orange.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s full grown,\u201d Rhiannon argues. \u201cThere\u2019 s no way the other dragons allow a baby to bond. No human alive has ever seen a baby .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake all right.\u201d Tynan looks at the golden one and scoffs. \u201cYou should totally bond it, Sorrengail. You\u2019re both freakishly weak. It\u2019s a match made in heaven.\u201d \u201cIt looks powerful enough to burn you to death,\u201d I counter , heat flushing my cheeks. He called me weak , and not just in front of our squad but in front of them. Sawyer lunges between us, grabbing Tynan\u2019 s collar . \u201cDon\u2019 t ever say that about a squadmate, especially not in front of unbonded dragons.\u201d \u201cLet him go\u2014he\u2019 s just saying what we\u2019re all thinking,\u201d Luca mutters. I turn slowly to stare at her, my mouth slightly agape.",
  "Is this what happens to us the second we\u2019re out of hearing range of any superior cadet?",
  "We turn on one another . \u201cWhat?\u201d She gestures to my hair. \u201cHalf your hair is silver and you\u2019re\u2026 petite,\u201d she finishes with a fake smile. \u201cGolden and\u2026small. Y ou match.\u201d Trina puts her hand on Sawyer \u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019 t make a mistake in front of them. We don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do,\u201d she whispers. And now we\u2019re grouped up. I shuf fle backward a little as Sawyer drops T ynan\u2019 s collar . \u201cSomeone shoul d kill it before it bonds,\u201d Tynan sputters, and for the firsttime in my life, I actually want to kick someone while they\u2019re down\u2026and keep kicking until they stay down. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to get its rider killed, and it\u2019s not like we get a choice if it wants to bond us.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just picking up on that now , are you?\u201d Ridoc shakes his head. \u201cWe should go back,\u201d Pryor says, his gaze darting around the group. \u201cI mean\u2026if you think we should. W e don\u2019 t have to, of course.\u201d \u201cFor once in your life,\u201d Tynan says, pushing past Pryor to start down the path, \u201cmake a damn decision, Pryor .\u201d We take off one by one, leaving the suggested space between us.",
  "Rhiannon goes before me this time and Ridoc follows behind, with Luca bringing up the rear . \u201cThey\u2019re pretty incredible, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Ridoc says, and the wonder in his voice makes me smile. \u201cThey are,\u201d I agree. \u201cThey\u2019re hones tly a little underwhelming after seeing that blue at Parapet.\u201d Luca\u2019 s voice carries all the way to Rhiannon, who turns around with an incredulous look. \u201cLike this isn\u2019 t stressful enough without you insulting them?\u201d Rhi asks. I need to defuse this quickly . \u201cI mean, it could be worse. We could be walking past a line of wyvern, right?\u201d \u201cOh please, Violet, do give us one of your nervous-babble story times,\u201d Luca says sarcastically . \u201cLet me guess. Wyvern are some elite squad of gryphon riders created because of something we did at a battle only you can manage to remember with your scribe brain.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a wyvern is?\u201d Rhi asks, then begins walking again. \u201cDidn\u2019 t your parents tell you bedtime stories, Luca?\u201d \u201cDo enlighten me,\u201d Luca drawls.",
  "I roll my eyes, continuing along the path. \u201cThey\u2019re folklore,\u201d I say over my shou lder. \u201cKind of like drago ns but bigger , with two feet instead of four, a mane of razor -sharp feathers streaking down their necks, and a taste forhumans. Unlike dragons , who think we \u2019 re a little gamey . \u201d \u201c My mom used to love telling my sister Raegan and me that we \u2019 d be plucked right off the front porch by one if we talked back , and their eerie- eyed venin riders would take us prisoner if we took treats we weren \u2019 t allowed to have , \u201d Rhi says , flash ing a grin at me , and I can \u2019 t help but notice that her step is lighter . Mine is, too.",
  "I notice each dragon as we pass, but my heartbeat steadies. \u201cMy dad used to read to me those fables every night,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAnd I seriously asked him one time if Mom was going to turn into a venin because she could channel.\u201d Rhiannon chuckles as we walk by a set of glaring reds.",
  "\u201c Did he tell you people supposed ly only turn into venin if they channel directly from the source ? \u201d \u201c He did , but it was after my mom had a really long night while we were stationed near the eastern border , and her eyes were bloodsh ot red , so I freaked out and started shriekin g. \u201d I can \u2019 t help but smile at the memory . \u201cShe took my book of fables away for a month because the outpost guards all came running, and I was hiding behind my brother , who couldn\u2019 t stop laughing, and, well\u2026it was a mess.\u201d I keep my eyes front and center as a large orange snif fs the air when I pass. Rhiannon\u2019 s shou lders shake with laughter . \u201cI wish we\u2019d had a book like that.",
  "I seriously think Mom just altered the stories to scare us whenever we stepped out of line.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like some border -village nonsense.\u201d Luca scoffs. \u201cVenin? Wyvern? Anyon e with a modicu m of education knows that our wards stop all magic that isn\u2019 t channeled directly from dragons.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re stories , Luca,\u201d Rhi says over her shou lder, and I can\u2019t help but notice how much ground we\u2019ve covered. \u201cPryor , you can walk a little faster if you want up there.\u201d \u201cMaybe we should slow down and take our time?\u201d Pryor suggests fromahead of Rhiannon, rubbing his palms along the sides of his uniform. \u201cOr I guess we can go faster if we want to get out of here.\u201d A red steps out of line, puttin g one claw forward toward us, and my stomach drops to the ground from the weight of the dread filling my entire body . \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d I whisper , freezing in place, but it\u2019 s too late. The red opens its mouth, exposi ng sharp, glistening fangs, and fire erupts along the sides of its tongue, streaming through the air and into the path ahead of Rhiannon. She yells in shock. Heat blasts the front of my face. Then it\u2019 s over .",
  "The scent of sulfur and burned grass\u2026burned\u2026 something fills my lungs, and I see a charred patch of ground in front of Rhiannon that hadn\u2019 t been there before. \u201cAre you all right, Rhi?\u201d I call forward. She nods, but the movement is hurried and jerky . \u201cPryor is\u2026 He\u2019 s\u2026\u201d Pryor \u2019s dead. My mouth wate rs like I\u2019m going to vomit, but I breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth until the feeling passes. \u201cKeep walking!\u201d Sawyer shouts from farther down the path. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Rhi. You just have to\u2026\u201d She just has to what ? Walk over his corpse? Is there a corpse? \u201cFire\u2019 s out,\u201d Rhiannon says over her shoulder . I nod, because there\u2019 s nothing I can say to reassure her . Holy shit are we insignificant.",
  "She walks forwa rd and I follow , maneuvering around the pile of ash that used to be Pryor . \u201cOh my gods, the smell ,\u201d Luca complains. \u201cCould you please have some level of decency?\u201d I snap, turning around to level a glare at her , but Ridoc\u2019 s face makes me pause. His eyes are as wide as saucers, and his mouth hangs open. \u201cV iolet.\u201dIt\u2019s a whisper , and I wonder briefly if I heard him as much as I saw the word forming on his lips. \u201cVi\u2014\u201d A warm huff of steam blows against the back of my neck. My heart thunders, the beat increasing erratically as I take what might be my last breath and turn toward the line of dragons. The golden eyes of not one but two greens meet mine, consuming my field of vision. Oh. Fuck. To approach a green dragon, lower your eyes in supplication and wait for their appr oval.",
  "That\u2019 s what I read, right? I drop my gaze as one chuffs another breath at me. It\u2019s hot and appallingly wet, but I\u2019m not dead yet, so that\u2019 s a plus. The one on the right chortles deep in its throat. Wait, is that the sound of approval I\u2019m looking for? Shit, I wish I\u2019d asked Mira. Mira . She\u2019 s going to be devastated when she reads the rolls. I lift my head and suck in a sharp breath. They\u2019re even closer . The one on the left nudges my hands with its giant nose, but I somehow stand my ground, rocking back on my heels to keep from falling over . Greens ar e the most r easonable. \u201cI cut my hands climbing the obstacle course.\u201d I lift my palms, like they can see through the black fabric binding my wounds. The one on the right sets its nose right at my breasts and chuf fs again. What. The. Hell.",
  "It inhales, making that noise in its throat, and the other shove s its nose into my ribs, making me raise my arms just in case they feel like taking a little nibble. \u201cViolet!\u201d Rhiannon whisper -shouts. \u201cI\u2019m all right!\u201d I call back, then wince, hoping I didn\u2019 t just seal my fate by screaming in their ears.Another chuff. Another chortle, like they\u2019re talking to each other as they sniff me. The one under my arm moves its nostrils to my back and snif fs again. Realization hits and I choke out a tight, surreal laugh. \u201cYou smell Teine, don\u2019t you?\u201d I ask quietly . They both draw back, just far enough for me to look them in their golden eyes, but they keep their jaws shut, giving me the courage to keep talking. \u201cI\u2019m Mira\u2019 s sister , Violet.\u201d Slowly lowering my arms, I run my hands over my snot-covered vest and the armor carefully sewn into it. \u201cShe collected Teine\u2019 s scales after he shed them last year and had them shrunk down so she could sew them into the vest to help keep me safe.\u201d The one on the right blinks. The one on the left sticks its nose in again, snif fing loudly . \u201cThe scales have saved me a few times,\u201d I whisper .",
  "\u201cBut no one else knows they\u2019re in there. Just Mira and T eine.\u201d They both blink at me, and I lower my gaze, bowing my head because it feels like the thing to do. Profess or Kaori taught us every way to approach a dragon and exactly zero ways to disengage one.",
  "Step by step, they retreat until I see them take up their places in line in my peripherals, and I finally raise my head. Taking several deep breaths, I try to lock my muscles to keep from trembling. \u201cViolet.\u201d Rhiannon is only a few feet away , a look of terror in her eyes. She must have been right behind their heads. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I force a smile and nod. \u201cI have dragon-scale armor under the vest,\u201d I whisper . \u201cThey smell my sister \u2019s dragon.\u201d If she wants trust, there it is. \u201cPlease don\u2019 t tell anyone.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019 t,\u201d she whispers. \u201cY ou\u2019re all right?\u201d \u201cOther than having a few years of my life shaved off.\u201d I laugh. The sound is shaky , bordering on hysteria.\u201cLet\u2019 s get out of here.\u201d She swallows, her gaze darting toward the line of dragons. \u201cGood idea.\u201d She turns and walks back to her place, and once there\u2019 s fifteen feet between us, I follow . \u201cI think I just shat myself,\u201d Ridoc says, and my laughter only pitches higher as we move through the field. \u201cHonestly , I thought they were going to eat you,\u201d Luca remarks. \u201cMe too,\u201d I admit. \u201cI wouldn\u2019 t have blamed them,\u201d she continues. \u201cYou\u2019re insuf ferable,\u201d Ridoc calls back.",
  "I focus on the path and keep walking. \u201cWhat? She\u2019s obviously our weakest link after Pryor , and I don\u2019t blame them for snuffing him out,\u201d she argues. \u201cHe could never make a decision, and no one wants someone like that as their rider\u2014\u201d A blast of heat singes my back and I halt. Don\u2019 t be Ridoc. Don\u2019 t be\u2014 \u201cGuess the dragons think she\u2019 s insuf ferable, too,\u201d Ridoc mutters.

Monday , Wednesday , or Sunday , it doesn\u2019 t matter where it falls on any given year. On the first of October , the first-year cadets of the Riders Quadrant enter the bowl-shaped forested valley to the southwest of the citadel and pray they come out alive.",
  "I will not die today . I didn\u2019t bother eating this morning, and I pity Ridoc, who\u2019 s currently heaving up the contents of his stomach against a tree to my right. A sword is strapped to Rhiannon\u2019 s back, the hilt jostling against her spine as she bounces, stretching her arms across her chest one at a time. \u201cRemember to listen here,\u201d Professor Kaori says from in front of the 147 of us here, tapping his chest. \u201cIf a dragon has already selected you, they\u2019ll be calling.\u201d He thumps his chest again. \u201cSo pay attention to not just your surroundings but your feelings, and go with them.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cAnd if your feelings are telling you to go in the other direction\u2026lis ten to that, too.\u201d \u201cWhich one are you going for?\u201d Rhiannon asks quietly . \u201cI don\u2019t know .\u201d I shake my head but can\u2019t ditch the feeling of absolute failure in my chest.",
  "At this point, Mira knew she wanted to seek out T eine. \u201cYou memorize d the cards, right?\u201d she asks, lifting her brows. \u201cSo you know what\u2019 s out there?\u201d\u201cYes. I just don\u2019t feel connected to any of them.\u201d Which is better than feeling connecte d to a dragon another rider has their eye on. I have no desire to fight to the death today . \u201cDain tried talking me into a brown.\u201d \u201cDain lost his vote when he tried talking you into leaving ,\u201d she counters. There\u2019 s a lot of truth to that.",
  "I\u2019ve only talked to him once in the past two days since Presentation, and he tried to get me to run within the first five minutes. We\u2019ve only seen professors this morning, but I know the second- and third-year riders are scattered throughout this valley in order to observe. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d She grins. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about that green. The one closest to me when they got all up close and personal with you.\u201d \u201cWell, it didn\u2019 t eat you, so that\u2019s a promising start.\u201d I smile despite the fear racing through my veins. \u201cI think so, too.\u201d She links her arm with mine, and I focus back on what Professor Kaori is telling us. \u201cIf you go in groups, you\u2019re more likely to be incinerated than bonded,\u201d Professor Kaori argues with someone near the center of the valley . \u201cThe scribes have run the statistics. Y ou\u2019re better of f on your own.\u201d \u201cAnd what if we aren\u2019 t chosen by dinner?\u201d a man with a short beard to my left asks. Looking past him, I catch Jack Barlowe running a finger across his neck at me.",
  "So original. Then Oren and T ynan flank his sides. So much for squad loyalty . It\u2019s everyone for themselves today . \u201cIf you\u2019re not chosen by nightfall, there\u2019 s a problem,\u201d Professor Kaori responds, his thick mustache turned down at the ends. \u201cYou\u2019ll be brought out by a profess or or senior leadership, so don\u2019t give up and think we\u2019ve forgotten about you.\u201d He checks his pocket watch. \u201cRemember to spread out and use every foot of this valley to your advantage. It\u2019s nine, which means they should be flying in any minute now.",
  "The only other words I have for you are \u2018good luck.\u2019\u201d He nods, sweeping his gaze over the crowdof us with such intensity that I know he\u2019ll be able to re-create this moment in a projection. Then he leaves, marching up the hill to our right and disappearing into the trees. My mind whirls. It\u2019s time. I\u2019ll either leave this forest as a rider\u2026or likely never leave. \u201cBe careful.\u201d Rhiannon pulls me into a hug, her braids swinging over my shoulder as she tightens her arms around me. \u201cYou too.\u201d I squeeze her back and am immediately swept into another pair of arms. \u201cDon\u2019 t die,\u201d Ridoc orders. That\u2019 s our only goal as what\u2019 s left of our squad separates, each heading in our own direction like we\u2019ve been flung apart by centrifugal motion, at the mercy of a spinning wheel. \u2026 Guessing by the position of the sun, it\u2019 s been at least a couple of hours since the dragons flew overhead, landing in the valley in a succession that sounded like thunder and making the earth shake. I\u2019ve come across two greens, a brown, four oranges, and\u2014 My heart stumbles and my feet freeze to the forest floor as a red steps into my field of vision, its head just under the canopy of enormous trees. This is not my dragon.",
  "I\u2019m not sure how I know , but I do. I hold my breath, trying not to make a sound as its head sweeps right, then left, and my gaze plummets to the ground as I bow my head. For the last hour or so, I\u2019ve seen dragons launch into the air with a cadet \u2014now a rider\u2014on their back, but I\u2019ve also seen more than a couple of plumes of smoke, and I have no desire to be one of those. The dragon huffs a breath, then continues along its path, its clubtail flicking upward and catching one of the lower -hanging branches. The limbfalls to the ground with a monstrous crash, and only after the footsteps recede do I finally raise my head. I\u2019ve now come across every color of dragon, and none of them has spoken to me or given me the sense of connection we\u2019re reportedly supposed to feel. My stom ach sinks. What if I\u2019m one of the cadets who\u2019 s destined to never become a rider? One who\u2019 s thrown back time and again to restart first year until eventually something puts me on the death roll? Has this all been for nothing? The thought is too heavy to carry .",
  "Maybe if I could just see the valley, then I\u2019d get a feeling like Professor Kaori was talking about. I spot the nearest climbable tree and get to work, scaling branch after branch. Pain radiates from my hands, but I don\u2019t let it distract me. The bark catching the wraps that still cover my palms\u2026 Now that\u2019s an annoyance that makes me pause every few feet and pull the cloth free of the bark. Pretty sure the higher branches aren\u2019 t going to support my weight, so I stop about three-quarters to the top and survey the immediate area. There are a few greens in plain sight to my left, standing out against the fall foliage. Oddly enough, this is the one time of year when oranges, browns, and reds have the highest chance of blending in. I watch the trees for movement and spot a couple more directly south, but there\u2019 s no pull, no aching need to head in that direction, which probably means those aren\u2019 t mine, either . Relief hits me embarrassingly hard when I count at least half a dozen first-years wand ering aimlessly . I shouldn\u2019 t be so happy that they haven\u2019 t found their dragons, either , but at least I\u2019m not the only one, which gives me hope.",
  "There\u2019 s a clearing to the north, and my eyes narrow as a flash, like a mirror , catches the sun.Or like a golden dragon. Guess the little feathertail is still out here appeasing its curiosity . But I\u2019m apparently not going to find my dragon up a tree, so I climb down carefully and as quietly as possible. My feet hit the ground just before voices approach, and I tuck myself against the trunk to hide from being seen.",
  "We\u2019re not supposed to be in groups. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I think I saw it headed this way.\u201d It\u2019s a cock y voice I immediately recognize as T ynan. \u201cYou\u2019d better be right, because if we just hiked all the way the fuck over here just to find nothing, I\u2019m going to run you through.\u201d My stomach twists. It\u2019 s Jack. No one else\u2019 s voice has that physical ef fect on me, not even Xaden\u2019 s. \u201cYou sure we shouldn\u2019 t be spending our time looking for our own dragons instead of hunting the freak down?\u201d Recognition tickles the edges of my mind, but I lean out from my hiding place just to be sure. Yep, it\u2019s Oren. I dart back behind the cover of the tree as the trio passes, each strapped with a deadly sword. There are nine daggers tucked against my body in various places, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m unarmed, but I feel tragically disadvantaged by my inability to wield a sword effectively . They\u2019re just too damned heavy . Wait\u2026what did they say they were doing? Hunting? \u201cIt\u2019s not like our dragons are going to bond other riders,\u201d Jack snaps. \u201cThey\u2019ll wait for us. This has to be done. That scrawny one is going to get someone killed.",
  "W e have to take it out.\u201d Nausea swirls in my stomach, and my fingernails bite into my palms.",
  "They\u2019re going to try and kill the little golden one. \u201cIf we get caught, we\u2019re fucked,\u201d Oren comments. That\u2019 s an understatement. I can\u2019t imagine dragons would take kindly to killing one of their own, but they seem to be focused on culling the weakfrom the herd in our species, so it\u2019s not a stretch to imagine they do the same with their own. \u201cThen you\u2019d better shut your mouth so no one hears us,\u201d Tynan counters, his voice rising in that mocking tone that makes me want to punch him in the face. \u201cIt\u2019s for the best,\u201d Jack argues, his tone dropping. \u201cIt\u2019s unrideable, a certified freak, and you know feathertails are useless in combat. They refuse to fight.\u201d His voice fades as they walk farther away , headed north. Toward the clearing. \u201cShit,\u201d I mutter under my breath even though the assholes are out of hearing range by now. No one knows anything about feathertail s, so I don\u2019t know where Jack is getting his information, but I don\u2019t have time to focus on his assumptions right now . I have no way of contacting Professor Kaori, and there hasn\u2019 t even been a hint that the senior riders are watching us, so I can\u2019t count on them to stop this madness, either.",
  "The golden dragon should be able to breathe fire, but what if it can\u2019 t? There\u2019 s a chance they won\u2019 t find it, but\u2026 Shit, I can\u2019t even convince myself of that one. They\u2019re headed the right way and that dragon is pretty much a shiny beacon. They\u2019ll find it.",
  "My shoulders sag and I sigh at the sky , blowing out a frustrated breath. I can\u2019 t just stand here and do nothing. You can get ther e first and warn it. Solid plan, and way better than option two, where I\u2019d be forced to take on three armed men with at least a combined two hundred pounds on me. I keep my foots teps silent and race across the forest floor at a slightly different angle than Jack\u2019 s little posse, thankful I grew up playing hide-and- seek with Dain in the woods. This is one area of expertise I can confidently claim. They\u2019ve got a head start on me, and the clearing is closer than I realized,so I kick up my speed, my gaze darting between the leaf-covered path I\u2019ve chosen and where I think\u2014scratch that, where I know they are toward the left. I can make out their lumbering shapes in the distance. I hear a pop, and the ground falls out from under me, then rushes for my face. My hands fly out to brace myself a second before I slam into the forest floor . I bite into my lower lip to keep from crying out as my ankle screams. Popping isn\u2019 t good. It\u2019 s never good. Glancing back, I curse at the fallen branch, hidden by fall foliage, that\u2019s just wrecked my ankle.",
  "Shit. Block the pain. Block it.",
  "But there\u2019 s no mental trick to keep the shooting agony from turning my stomach as I drag myself to my knees and rise carefully , keeping my weight on my left ankle. There\u2019 s nothing to do but limp the final dozen feet to the clearin g, gritting my teeth the whole way. The tinge of satisfaction that I beat Jack here is almost enough to make me smile. The meadow is big enough for ten dragons, ringed by several large trees, but the golden one stands alone in the center , like it\u2019s trying to get a suntan. It\u2019s just as beautiful as I remember , but unless it can breathe fire, it\u2019s a sitting duck. \u201cYou have to get out of here!\u201d I hiss from the cover of the trees , knowing it should be able to hear me. \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill you if you don\u2019 t leave!\u201d Its head pivots toward me, then tilts at an angle that makes my own neck hurt. \u201cYes!\u201d I whisper loudly . \u201cYou! Goldie!\u201d It blinks its golden eyes and swishes its tail. You have to be fucking kidding me . \u201cGo! Run! Fly!\u201d I shoo at it, then remember it\u2019s a godsdamned dragon, capable of shredding me with its claws alone, and drop my hands. This is not going well. It\u2019 s going the opposite of well.",
  "The trees rustle from the south, and Jack steps into the clearing, his swordswaying in his right hand. A step later, he\u2019s flanked by Oren and Tynan, both their weapons drawn. \u201cShit,\u201d I mutter , my chest tightening. This is now officially going horribly . The golden dragon\u2019 s head snaps in their direction, a low growl rumbling in its chest. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it painless,\u201d Jack promises, like that makes the murder acceptable. \u201cScorch them,\u201d I whisper -shout , my heart pounding as they draw closer . But the dragon doesn\u2019 t, and somehow , I\u2019m certain in the marrow of my bones that it can\u2019t. Other than its teeth, it\u2019s defenseless against three trained warriors. It\u2019s going to die just because it\u2019 s smaller , weaker than the other dragons\u2026 just like me. My throat closes. The dragon backs up, its growl growing louder as it bares its teeth. Stomach pitchin g, I have that Parapet feeling again\u2014whatever I do next has overwhelming odds of ending my life. And yet, I\u2019m still going to do it because this is wrong.",
  "\u201cYou can\u2019t do this!\u201d I take the first step into the shin-high grass and Jack\u2019 s attention swings my way. My ankle has a heartbeat of its own, and agony streaks up my spine, chattering my teeth as I force my weight onto my ruined joint so they won\u2019 t see me limping. They can\u2019t know I\u2019m hurt, or they\u2019ll just attack faster . One at a time, I stand a chance of holding them off long enough for the dragon to escape, but together\u2026 Don\u2019 t think about it. \u201cOh, look!\u201d Jack grins, pointing his sword my way. \u201cWe can take out both the weakest links at the same time!\u201d He looks at his friends and laughs, pausing their advance. Each step hurts worse than the last, but I make it to the center of theclearing, putting myself between Jack\u2019 s group and the golden dragon. \u201cBeen waiting a long time for this, Sorrengail.\u201d He walks forward slowly . \u201cIf you can fly, now would be a good time,\u201d I shout over my shoulder at the small dragon, drawing two daggers from the sheaths at my ribs. The dragon chuf fs. So helpful.",
  "\u201cYou can\u2019t kill a dragon,\u201d I try reasoning, shaking my head at the trio, fear lacing my veins with adrenaline. \u201cSure we can.\u201d Jack shrugs, but Oren looks a little uncertain, so I pin my gaze on him as they spread out slightly about a dozen feet away , setting up the perfect formation for an attack. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d I say directly to Oren. \u201cIt goes against everything we believe in!\u201d He flinches. Jack doesn\u2019 t. \u201cLetting someth ing so weak , so incapable of fighting, live is against our beliefs!\u201d Jack shouts, and I know he\u2019 s not just talking about the dragon. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get through me, then.\u201d My heart thunders against my ribs as I raise my daggers, flipping one to pinch the tip so I\u2019m ready to throw and measuring the twenty or so feet separating me from my attackers. \u201cI don\u2019 t really consider that a problem,\u201d Jack snarls. They all lift their swords, and I draw a deep breath, readying myself to fight. This isn\u2019t the mat. There are no instructors. No yielding. Nothing to stop them slaughtering me\u2026slaughtering us.",
  "\u201cI would strongly recommend you rethink your actions,\u201d a voice\u2014 his voice\u2014demands from across the field to my right. My scalp prickles as each of our heads swivel in his direction. Xaden is leaning against the tree , his arms folded across his chest , and behind him , watching with narrowed golden eyes , her fangs exposed , is Sgaeyl , his terrifying navy-blue daggertail.In the six centuries of r ecorded history of dragon and rider , ther e have been hundr eds of known cases wher e a dragon simply can not emotionally r ecover fr om the loss of their bonded rider . This happens when the bond is particularly str ong and, in thr ee documented cases, has even caused the untimely death of the dragon. \u2014N AVARRE , AN UNEDITED HISTORY BY COLONEL LEWIS MARKHAM CHAPTER FOURTEEN Xaden.",
  "For the first time, the sight of him fills my chest with hope. He won\u2019 t let this happen. He might hate me, but he\u2019s a wingleader . He can\u2019t just watch them kill a dragon. But I know the rules probably better than anyone else in this quadrant. He has to. Bile rises in my throat, and I tilt my chin to quell the burning. What Xaden wants, which is always debatable, doesn\u2019 t matter here. He can only observe, not interfere. I\u2019m going to have an audience for my death. Fantastic. So much for hope. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019 t want to rethink our actions ?\u201d Jack shouts. Xaden looks toward me, and I swear I can see his jaw clench, even from this far away . Hope is a fickle, danger ous thing. It steals your focus and aims it towar d the possibilities instead of keeping it wher e it belongs\u2014on the probabilities . Xaden\u2019 s words come back to me with alarming clarity , and I rip my gaze from his and concentrate on the three probabilities in front of me. \u201cThere\u2019 s nothing you can do, right?",
  "Wingleader? \u201d Jack bellows.Guess he knows the rules, too. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you should worry about today ,\u201d Xaden responds and Sgaeyl tilts her head, nothing but menace in her eyes when I glance over . \u201cYou really going to do this?\u201d I ask T ynan. \u201cAttack a squadmate?\u201d \u201cSquads don\u2019t mean shit today ,\u201d he seethes, menace curling his lips into a sinister smile. \u201cSo I guess that\u2019s a no on the flying?\u201d I toss over my shoulder again, and the golden dragon chuffs low in its throat in response. \u201cGreat. Well, if you can back me up with those claws, I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d It chuf fs twice, and I spare a glance down at its claws. Or should I say\u2026paws. \u201cOh, fucking hell. You don\u2019 t have any claws?\u201d I turn back to the three men just as Jack roars a battle cry and sprints toward me. I don\u2019t hesitate. I whip my blade across the rapidly closing space between us, and the dagge r finds its mark in the shoulder of his sword arm. His sword falls as he hits his knees, crying out this time in pain. Good.",
  "But Oren and T ynan have char ged at the same time, and they\u2019re almost on me. I fling my second dagger at Tynan and catch him in the thigh, slowing but not stopping him. Oren swings for my neck and I duck, unsheathing another blade and slicing him along the ribs just like I did during our challenge. My ankle isn\u2019t going to let me kick, or even land a decent punch, so it\u2019s up to my blades. He recovers quickly and pivots with the sword, catching me at my stomach in a clean slice that would eviscerate me if not for Mira\u2019 s armor . Instead, the blade skims the scales, sliding right of f me. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Oren\u2019 s eyes fly wide. \u201cShe\u2019 s destroye d my shoulder!\u201d Jack cries, stumbling to his feet and distracting the others. \u201cI can\u2019 t move it!\u201d He clutches the joint, and I grin.\u201cThat\u2019 s the thing about having weak joints,\u201d I say, palming another blade. \u201cYou know exactly where to strike.\u201d \u201cKill her!\u201d Jack orders, still clutching his shoulder as he back s away a few steps, then turns and runs in the opposite direction, disappearing into the tree line in no time. Fucking coward.",
  "Tynan jabs with his sword and I spin away , white-hot pain stealing my sight for a heartbeat before I swipe backward, plunging my dagger into his side, then pivot ing, shoving my elbow up into Oren\u2019 s chin as he attacks, rattling his head. \u201cYou fucking bitch !\u201d Tynan screams, pressing his palm against his oozing side. \u201cSuch an original\u201d\u2014I take advantage of Oren\u2019 s dazed expression and slice open his hip\u2014\u201cinsult!\u201d The move costs me, and a scream rips from my throat as Tynan\u2019 s sword cuts into my upper right arm, along the direction of the bone. The armor keeps it from penetr ating my ribs, but I know I\u2019ll have a hell of a bruise tomo rrow as I wren ch myself away , blood flowing freely as I peel myself of f the sword.",
  "\u201cBehind you!\u201d Xaden shouts. I pivot to see Oren\u2019 s sword held high, ready to separate my head from my shoulders, but the golden dragon snaps its jaw and Oren stumbles to the side with terror -filled eyes, as if he\u2019 s just now realized that it has teeth. I sidestep and knock the handle of my blade against the base of his skull. He crumples, unconscious, and I don\u2019t wait to see him fall before turning back toward T ynan, who has his bloodied sword ready . \u201cYou can\u2019t interfere!\u201d Tynan shouts at Xaden, but I don\u2019t dare look away from my opponent long enough to see how the wingleader reacts. \u201cNo, but I can narrate,\u201d Xaden retorts.",
  "He\u2019s obviously on my side here, which confuses the hell out of me, sincemore than anything, I\u2019m certain he wants me dead. But maybe it\u2019s not my life he\u2019 s protecting but the golden dragon\u2019 s. I chance a quick glance. Yeah, Sgaeyl looks pissed. Her head undulates in a serpentine motion\u2014a clear sign of agitation\u2014and those narrowed golden eyes of hers are focused on Tynan, who is now trying to circle me like we\u2019re on the mat, but I won\u2019 t let him get between me and the little golden dragon. \u201cYour arm is shot, Sorrengail,\u201d T ynan hisses, his face pale and sweaty . \u201cI\u2019m used to functioning in pain, asshole. Are you?\u201d I raise the dagger in my right hand just to prove that I can despite the blood that runs down my arm and drips from the tip of my blade, saturating the wrap across my palm. My gaze drops meaningfully to his side. \u201cI know exactly where I sliced into you. If you don\u2019 t get to a healer soon, you\u2019ll bleed out internally .\u201d Rage contorts his features, and he moves to strike. I try to flick my knife at him, but it slips from my blood-soaked hand and lands with a thud in the grass several feet away .",
  "And I know my bravado won\u2019 t be enough to save me now . My arm is shot. My leg is shot. But at least I made Jack Barlowe run away before I died. As a last thought, that\u2019 s not a bad one.",
  "Just as Tynan reaches up to two-hand his sword, preparing for a killing blow , I catch a glimpse of movement to my right. It\u2019s Xaden. And rules be damned, he steps forward as though he intends to stop Tynan from killing me. I barely have a moment to register surprise that Xaden would ever save me, for any reason, when a gust of wind slams into my back, and I stumble forward onto my destroyed ankle, flinging my arms out to keep my balance and grimacing at the shooting pain. Tynan\u2019 s mouth hangs open and he staggers backward, his head tilting so far back it\u2019s nearly perpendicular to his torso. Shade envelops us both as hecontinues to back away . Chest heaving, my lungs desperate for air, I chance a look over my shoulder to see why T ynan\u2019 s retreating. And my heart lurches into my throat. Standing with the golden one tucked under an enormous, scarred black wing is the biggest dragon I\u2019ve ever seen in my life\u2014the unbo nded black dragon Professo r Kaori showed us in class. I don\u2019t even come close to reaching its ankle .",
  "A growl resonates through its chest, vibrating the ground aroun d me as it lowers its gigantic head, baring dripping teeth. Fear ripples through every cell in my body as its hot breath blows over me. \u201cStep aside, Silver One,\u201d a deep, gruf f, definitely male voice orders. I blink. W ait. What? Did he just speak to me? \u201cYes. You. Move.\u201d There\u2019s zero room for argumen t in his tone, and I limp to the side, nearl y stumbling over Oren\u2019 s unconscious body as Tynan breaks into a screaming run, fleeing for the trees. The black drago n\u2019s eyes narrow to glare at Tynan and he opens his mouth wide a second before fire shoots across the field, blasting heat against the side of my face and incinerating everything in its path\u2026including T ynan. Flames crackle at the edges of the blackened path, and I turn slowly to face the dragon, wondering if I\u2019m about to be next. His giant golden eyes study me, but I hold my ground, tilting my chin upward. \u201cYou should end the enemy at your feet.\u201d My eyebrows jerk upward. His mouth didn\u2019 t move. He spoke to me, but\u2026his mouth didn\u2019 t move. Oh shit.",
  "Because he\u2019s in my head. \u201cI can\u2019t kill an unconscious man.\u201d I shake my head, though whether it\u2019s in protest at his suggestion or a result of my confusion is up for debate. \u201cHe would kill you if given the same chance.\u201dI glance down at Oren, still unconscious in the grass beside my feet. It\u2019s not like I can argue that astute assessment. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a statement on his character . Not mine.\u201d The dragon only blinks in respo nse, and I can\u2019t quite tell if that\u2019s a good thing or not. There\u2019 s a flash of blue out of the corner of my eye, then a whoosh of air as Xaden and Sgaeyl take off, leaving me here with the giant black dragon and the little golden one. Guess Xaden\u2019 s momentary concern for my life is over. The dragon\u2019 s giant nostrils flare. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding. Stop it.\u201d My arm. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple when you\u2019ve been run through with a\u2014\u201d I shake my head again. Am I seriously arguing with a dragon?",
  "This is so fucking surreal. \u201cYou know what? That\u2019s a great idea.\u201d I manage to cut off what remains of my right shirtsleeve and wrap it around the wound, holding one end of the fabric with my teeth as I tie it tight to apply pressure and slow the bleeding. \u201cThere. Better?\u201d \u201cIt will do.\u201d He tilts his head at me. \u201cYour hands are bound, too. Do you bleed often?\u201d \u201cI try not to.\u201d He scoffs. \u201cLet\u2019 s go, Violet Sorrengail.\u201d He lifts his head, and the golde n dragon peeks out from under his wing. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d I gawk up at him. \u201cAnd to think, I\u2019d almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are.\u201d He sighs, the gust of his breath rattling the trees. \u201cGet on my back.\u201d Oh. Shit. He\u2019 s choosing\u2026 me. \u201cGet on your back?\u201d I repeat like a fucking parrot. \u201cHave you seen you? Do you have any idea how huge you are?\u201d I\u2019d need a damned ladder to get up there. The look he gives me can only be described as annoyance. \u201cOne does notlive a century without being well awar e of the space one takes up.",
  "Now get on.\u201d The golden one moves out from under the shelter of the big one\u2019s wing. It\u2019s tiny compar ed to the monstr osity before me, and apparently completely defenseless with the exception of those teeth, like a playful puppy . \u201cI can\u2019t just leave it,\u201d I say . \u201cWhat if Oren wakes up or Jack comes back?\u201d The black dragon chuf fs. The golden one bends down, flexing its legs, and then launches into the sky, its golden wings catching the sun as it flies off, skimming the tops of the trees. So it can fly. That would have been nice to know twenty minutes ago.",
  "\u201cGet. On,\u201d the black drago n growls, shaking the ground and trees at the edge of the field. \u201cYou don\u2019 t want me,\u201d I ar gue. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you again.\u201d Point taken. Fear grasps my throat like a fist, and I hobble over to his leg. This isn\u2019t like climbing a tree. There are no handholds, no easy path, just a series of hard-as-stone scales that don\u2019t exactly give me a foothold. My ankle and arm aren\u2019t doing me any favors , either . How the hell am I going to get up there? I raise my left arm and suck in a breath before placing my hand on his front leg. The scales are larger and thicker than my hand and surprisingly warm to the touch. They layer into the next above them in an intricate pattern that leaves no space to grab hold.",
  "\u201cYou ar e a rider , are you not?\u201d \u201cThat seems up for debate at the moment.\u201d My heart thunders. Is he going to cook me alive for being too slow? A low, frustrated grumble sound s in his chest, and then he shocks me to the core as he stretches forward , his front leg becoming a ramp. Dragonsnever supplicate for anyone , and yet here he is, bowing to make it easier for me to climb on. It\u2019 s steep but manageable. I don\u2019t hesitate, crawling up his front leg on my hands and knees to balance my weight and spare my ankle, but the strain on my arm has me gasping by the time I climb over his shoulder and reach his back, dodging the pointed spikes that ripple down most of his neck like a mane. Holy shit.",
  "I\u2019m on the back of a dragon. \u201cSit.\u201d I see the seat\u2014the smooth, scaly divot, just in front of his wings\u2014and sit, bending my knees like Professor Kaori taught us. Then I grab ahold of the thick ridges of scales we call the pommel, where his neck meets his shoulders. Everything about him is bigger than any model we practiced on. My body isn\u2019t built to stay on any dragon, let alone one of his size. There\u2019 s no way I\u2019ll be able to stay seate d. This is about to be the first and last ride of my life. \u201cMy name is Tairneanach, son of Murtcuideam and Fiaclanfuil, descended fr om the cunning Dubhmadinn line.\u201d He stands to his full height, bringing me eye level with the canopy of trees around the clearing, and I squeeze a little tighter with my thighs. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to assume that you\u2019ll be able to remember that once we reach the field, so Tairn will do until I inevitably have to r emind you.\u201d I inhale swiftly , but there\u2019 s no time to process his name\u2014his history\u2014 before he bends slightly and launches us into the sky .",
  "It feels like I imagine a stone does after being flung from a catapult, except it takes every ounce of strength I have to stay on this particular stone. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d The ground falls away as we soar, Tairn\u2019s enormous wings beating the air into submission and pitching upward. My body lifts off his back, and I dig in with my hands, trying to keep anchored, but the wind, the angle, it\u2019 s all too much, and my grip falters.My hands slip. \u201cFuck!\u201d Scramb ling for purchase, my hands rake down Tairn\u2019s back as I skid past his wings, rapidly approaching the sharp scales of his morningstar tail. \u201cNo, no, NO!\u201d He bank s left and whatever hope I had of getting a handhold tumbles right of f with me. I\u2019m in free fall.Just because you survive Thr eshing doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll survive the ride to the flight field. Being chosen isn\u2019t the only test, and if you can\u2019t hold your seat, then you\u2019ll fly straight into the ground. \u2014P AGE FIFTY , THE BOOK OF BRENNAN CHAPTER FIFTEEN Terror clogs my throat and stutters my heart. Air rushes past me as I plummet toward the mountaino us terrain beneath, and the sun catches the scales of the golden one far beneath me. I\u2019m going to die.",
  "That\u2019 s the only possible outcome. Vises clamp around my ribs and over my shoulders, stopping my descent, and my body jerks with whiplash as I\u2019m yanked upward again. \u201cYou\u2019re making us look bad. Stop it.\u201d I\u2019m clasped in Tairn\u2019s claws. He\u2019s actually\u2026caught me instead of finding me unworthy and letting me fall to my death. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s easy to stay on your back when you\u2019re doing acrobatics!\u201d I shout up. He glances down at me, and I swear the ridge above his eye arches. \u201cSimple flight is har dly acr obatics.\u201d \u201cThere is absolu tely nothing simple about you!\u201d I wrap my arms around the knuckles of his claws, noting that his sharp talons are draped harmlessly around the sides of my body . He\u2019s huge, but he\u2019s also careful as he flies us along the mountain. He\u2019s one of the deadliest drago ns in Navarr e. Profess or Kaor i\u2019s lesson. What else had he said? The only unbonded black dragon hadn\u2019 t agreed to bond this year. He hadn\u2019 t even been seen in the last five years. His riderdied in the T yrrish rebellion.",
  "Tairn swings me upward and then releases me, sending me flying high above him, and I flail. My stomach drops at the height of his toss, and then I fall for two heartbeats before Tairn rushes up, catching me on his back between his wings. \u201cNow get in the seat and actually hold on this time, or no one is going to believe that I\u2019ve actually chosen you,\u201d he growls. \u201cI still can\u2019t belie ve you\u2019ve chosen me!\u201d I have half a mind to tell him that getting back to the seat isn\u2019t as easy as he\u2019s implying, but he levels out and his wings catch the air in a gentle glide, cutting the wind resistance. Inch by inch, I crawl up his back until I reach the seat and settle in again. I hold on to his ridges so hard, my hands cramp. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to str engthen your legs. Didn\u2019 t you practice?\u201d Indignation ripples up my spine. \u201cOf course I practiced!\u201d \u201cTher e\u2019s no need to shout. I can hear you just fine. The entire mountain can pr obably hear you.\u201d Was everyone\u2019 s dragon a curmudgeon? Or just mine? My eyes widen. I have\u2026a dragon. And not just any dragon. I have Tairneanach.",
  "\u201cGrip har der with your knees. I can bar ely feel you back ther e.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d I push my knees in and the muscles of my thighs tremble as he bank s left, softer this time than last, his angle not quite as steep as he changes course in a wide arc, taking us back toward Basgiath. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 not as strong as other riders.\u201d \u201cI know exactly who and what you ar e, Violet Sorr engail.\u201d My legs shake until they lock, the muscles freezing in place as though bands have been wrapped around them, but there\u2019 s no pain. I glance over my shoulder and see his morningstar tail, what feels like miles behind us. He\u2019s doing this. He\u2019 s holding me in place. Guilt settles in my stomach. I should have focused more on strengthtraining for my legs. I should have spent more time preparing myself for this. He shouldn \u2019t have to spend his energy on keeping his rider seated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry . I just didn\u2019 t think I\u2019d make it this far .\u201d A loud sigh resonates through my mind. \u201cI didn\u2019 t think I would, either , so we have that in common.\u201d I sit higher in the seat and look out over the landscape, wind ripping tears from the corners of my eyes.",
  "No wonder most riders choose to wear goggles. There are at least a dozen dragons in the air, each putting their rider through a trial of dips and turns. Reds, oranges, greens, browns, the sky is speckled with color . My heart lurches as I see a rider fall from the back of a Red Swordtail and, unlike Tairn, the dragon doesn\u2019 t dip to catch the first-year . I look away before the body hits the ground. It\u2019s not anyone you know .",
  "That\u2019s what I tell myself. Rhiannon, Ridoc, Trina, Sawyer\u2026 They\u2019re all probably safely bonded and already waiting at the field. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to put on a show .\u201d \u201cAwesome.\u201d The idea is anything but. \u201cYou will not fall. I will not allow it.\u201d The bands around my legs extend to my hands, and I feel the pulse of invisible ener gy. \u201cYou will trust me .\u201d Not a question. An order . \u201cLet\u2019 s get it over with.\u201d I can\u2019t move my legs, my fingers, my hands, so there\u2019 s nothing I can do but sit back and hope I enjoy whatever hell he\u2019s about to put me through. His wings give a mighty beat, and we lurch upward in what feels like a ninety-degree climb, leaving my stomach back at the lower altitude. He crests the top of the snow-dusted peaks, and we hang there for a breath of a second before he twists, diving back down at the same terrifying angle. It\u2019s the most horrifying and yet exhilarating moment of my life. Until he twists again, sending us into a spiral.My body is wrenched this way and that as he completes turn after turn, pulling us out of the dive only to bank so hard, I swear the land becomes the sky, then repeats it all until my face splits into a grin. There is nothing like this.",
  "\u201cI think we made our point.\u201d He pulls us level, then banks right, starting up the valley that leads to the box canyon of the training fields . The sun is close to setting behind the peaks, but there\u2019 s plenty of light to see the golden dragon up ahead, hovering as though it\u2019s waiting. Maybe it didn\u2019 t choose a rider, but it will live to decide again next year, and that\u2019s all that matters. Or maybe it will see that we humans aren\u2019 t so great after all. \u201cWhy did you choose me?\u201d I have to know , because as soon as we land, there are going to be questions. \u201cBecause you saved her.\u201d Tairn\u2019s head inclines toward the golden as we approach, and she follows after us. Our speed slows. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d I shake my head. \u201cDragons value strength and cunning and\u2026 ferocity in their riders.\u201d None of which defines me. \u201cPlease, do tell me more about what I should value.\u201d Sarcasm drips from his tone as we pass over the Gauntlet and crest the narrow entrance to the training fields. I suck in a sharp breath at the sight of so many dragons.",
  "There are hundreds gather ed along the rocky edges of the mountain slope s behind the bleachers that were erected overnight. Spectators. And at the bottom of the valley , in the same field I\u2019d walked only a couple of days before, are two lines of dragons facing each other . \u201cThey are divided between those still in the quadrant who chose in years past and those who chose today ,\u201d Tairn tells me. \u201cWe are the seventy-first bond to enter the fields.\u201d Mom will be here, on the dais in front of the bleachers, and maybe I\u2019ll get more than a cursory glance, but her attention will mostly be on the seventyor so newly bonded pairs. A ferocious roar of celebration goes up among the dragons as we fly in, every head swin ging our way, and I know it\u2019s in deference to Tairn. So is the parting of the dragons at the very center of the field, making room for Tairn to land. He releases the bands holding me in my seat, then hovers over the grass for a few wing beats, and I see the golden dragon flying furiously to catch up.",
  "How ironic. Tairn is the most celebrated dragon in the Vale, and I\u2019m the most unlikely rider in the quadrant. \u201cYou ar e the smartest of your year . The most cunning.\u201d I gulp at the compliment, brush ing it off. I was trained as a scribe, not a rider. \u201cYou defended the smallest with ferocity . And strength of courage is more important than physical strength. Since you appar ently need to know befor e we land.\u201d My throat tightens from his words, emotion forming a knot I have to swallow past. Oh. Shit. I hadn\u2019 t spoken those words. I\u2019d thought them. He can read my thoughts. \u201cSee? Smartest of your year .\u201d So much for privacy . \u201cYou\u2019ll never be alone again.\u201d \u201cThat sounds more like a threat than a comfort,\u201d I think. Of course I knew that drago ns maintain a mental bond with their riders, but the extent of it is more than a little daunting.",
  "Tairn scof fs in reply . The golden dragon reaches us, her wings beating twice as fast as Tairn\u2019s, and we land in the dead center of the field. The impact jars me slightly , but I sit up tall in the seat and even let go of the pommel ridges. \u201cSee, I can hang on just fine when you\u2019r e not moving.\u201dTairn tucks his wings up and looks over his shoulder at me with an expression that\u2019s the closest thing to a dragon rolling his eyes that I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cYou need to dismount befor e I rethink my selection, then tell the roll- keeper\u2014\u201d \u201cI know what to do.\u201d I pull in a shaky breath. \u201cI just didn\u2019 t think I\u2019d be alive to do it.\u201d Surveying both options for dismount, I move right to shelter my ankle as long as possible. There are no healers allowed in the flight field, only riders, but hopefully someone thought to pack a medical kit, because I\u2019m going to need stitches and a splint. I scoot over the scales of Tairn\u2019s shoulder and, before I can lament the distance I\u2019m about to have to jump on the wreckage of my ankle, Tairn shifts slightly , angling his front leg. There\u2019 s a sound from the slopes that reminds me of muttering\u2026if dragons mutter .",
  "\u201cThey do and they ar e. Ignor e it.\u201d Again, there\u2019 s no room for ar gument in his tone. \u201cThanks,\u201d I whisper , then slide down on my butt like he\u2019s a bumpy piece of lethal playground equipment, taking the brunt of the impact with my left leg when I hit the ground.",
  "\u201cThat\u2019 s one way to do it.\u201d I can\u2019t stop the smile on my face or the joy that stings my eyes at the sight of other first-years standing in front of their dragons. I\u2019m alive, and I\u2019m no longer a cadet. I\u2019m a rider . The first step hurts like hell, but I pivot toward the golden one, who is tucked in tight next to Tairn, surveying me with bright eyes as she flicks her feathertail. \u201cI\u2019m glad you made it.\u201d \u201cGla d\u201d isn\u2019t even the right word. Thrilled, relieved, grateful. \u201cBut maybe you should fly off the next time someone suggests you save yourself, eh?\u201d She blinks. \u201cMaybe I was saving you.\u201d Her voice is higher , sweeter inmy mind. My lips part, and the muscles in my face go slack with shock. \u201cDidn\u2019 t anyone tell you that you\u2019re not supposed to speak to humans who aren\u2019 t your rider? Don\u2019 t go getting yourself in trouble, Goldie,\u201d I whisper . \u201cFrom what I hear , dragons are pretty strict about breaking that rule.\u201d She simply sits, tucking her wings in, and tilts her head at me in that should-be-impossible angle that almost makes me laugh. \u201cHoly hell!\u201d the rider of the red dragon to my right exclaims, and I turn toward him.",
  "He\u2019s a first-year from Claw Section, Fourth Wing, but I don\u2019t remember his name. \u201cIs that\u2026 \u201d He openly stares with fear-wide eyes at Tairn. \u201cYeah,\u201d I say , smiling wider . \u201cHe is.\u201d My ankle throbs , aches, and generally feels like it\u2019s going to come apart at any second as I limp across the wide field, heading for the small formation directly ahead of me. Behind me, wind sporadically gusts as more dragons land and their riders dismount to have their names recorded, but it\u2019 s softer and softer as the line spreads farther down the field. Dusk falls, and a series of mage lights illuminates the crowd in the bleachers and on the dais. In the very center , right above where the redhead from Parapet is recording roll, sits my mother , dressed in all her military finery , medals and all, lest anyo ne forget exactly who she is. Though there is an assortmen t of generals on the dais, each representing their wing, there\u2019 s only one more highly decorated than Lilith Sorrengail. And Melgren, the commanding general of all Navarrian forces, has his beady eyes on Tairn in open assessment. His focus flicks toward me, and I suppress a shudder . There\u2019 s nothing but cold calculation in those eyes.",
  "Mom rises as I approach the roll-keeper at the base of the dais, who\u2019 s recording bonded pairs before motioning the next rider forward to maintain secrecy of a dragon\u2019 s full name. Professor Kaori jumps off the six-foot platform to my left and staresopen-mouthed at Tairn, his gaze sweeping over the massive black dragon, memorizing every single detail. \u201cIs that really\u2014 \u201d Commandant Panchek starts, hovering at the edge of the dais with more than a dozen other uniformed, high-ranking officers, all gaping. \u201cDon\u2019 t say it,\u201d Mom hisses, her eyes on Tairn, not me. \u201cNot until she does.\u201d Because only a rider and the roll-keeper know a dragon\u2019 s full name and she\u2019s not certain I\u2019m really his. That\u2019 s exactly what she\u2019s implying. Like I\u2019d be able to hijack Tairn. Anger simmers in my veins, overtaking the pain coursing through my body as I move forward in the line so there\u2019 s only one other rider ahead of me. Mom forced me into the Rider s Quadrant.",
  "She didn\u2019 t care if I lived or died as I crossed the parapet. The only thing she cares about now is how my flaws might mar her sterling reputation or how my bonding might further her own agenda. And now she\u2019s staring at my dragon without even bothering to look down and see if I\u2019m all right. Fuck. Her . It\u2019s everything I expected and yet still so disappointing. The rider ahead finishes, moving out of the way , and the roll-keeper looks up, glancing wide-eyed at Tairn before lowering her shocked gaze to mine and beckoning me forward. \u201cViolet Sorrengail,\u201d she says as she writes in the Book of Riders. \u201cNice to see that you made it.\u201d She offers me a quick, shaky smile. \u201cFor the record, please tell me the name of the dragon who chose you.\u201d I lift my chin. \u201cT airneanach.\u201d \u201cPronunciation could use some work.\u201d Tairn\u2019s voice rumbles through my head. \u201cHey , at least I remember ed,\u201d I think back in his general direction,wondering if he\u2019ll hear me across the field. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019 t let you fall to your death.\u201d He sounds utterly bored, but he definitely heard me.

  "The generals have been screaming at each other for the last half hour, long enough for a chill to settle in the night air and for an instructor I\u2019ve never met to sew up both sides of my arm.

There are about a million other questions in his slashing, dark eyes, but he keeps them to himself. \u201cHurts like hell.\u201d The swelling made it nearly impossible to get my boot back on without loosening every single lace to its widest position, but at least I didn\u2019 t have to crawl across the field like a girl from Second Wing who had broken her leg during dismount.

Professor Kaori\u2019 s eyebrows jump as he glances between us. \u201cYou?\u201d he murmurs. \u201cMe,\u201d I answer , keeping my focus on Jack. But Professor Kaori moves between us, throwing his palm out at Jack. \u201cI wouldn\u2019 t get any closer to her .\u201d \u201cHiding behind our instructors now, Sorrengail?\u201d Jack\u2019 s uninjured fist curls. \u201cI didn\u2019 t hide out there, and I\u2019m not hiding here.\u201d I raise my chin. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who ran.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to hide behind me when she\u2019s bonded to the most powerful dragon of your year,\u201d Professor Kaori warns Jack, whose eyes narrow on me.",
  "\u201cYour orange is a good choice, Barlowe. Baide, right? He\u2019s had four other riders before you.\u201d Jack nods. Professor Kaori looks back over his shoulder at the line of dragons. \u201cAs aggressive as Baide might be, from the way Tairn\u2019s looking at you, he\u2019ll have no problem scorching your bones into the earth if you take another step toward his rider .\u201d Jack stares at me in disbelief. \u201cY ou?\u201d \u201cMe.\u201d The throbbing in my ankle is down to a manageable, dull ache, even standing on it.",
  "He shakes his head, and the look in his eyes transforms from shock, to envy , to fear as he pivots toward the professor . \u201cI don\u2019t know what she toldyou about what happened out there\u2014\u201d \u201cNothing.\u201d The instructor folds his arms across his chest. \u201cIs there something I need to know?\u201d Jack pales, going white as a sheet in the mage light as another injured first-year hobbles over , blood streaming from his thigh and torso. \u201cEveryone who needs to know already knows.\u201d I lock eyes with Jack. \u201cGuess we\u2019re done for the night,\u201d Kaori says as a line of dragons flies in, only visible by their silhouettes in the darkness. \u201cThe senior riders are back. You two should return to your dragons.\u201d Jack huf fs and marches of f across the field. I glance at the generals still gathered in heated discussion on the dais. \u201cProfessor Kaori, has anyone ever bonded two dragons?\u201d If anyone knows, it\u2019s the professor of Dragonkind. He turns with me to face the arguing leadership.",
  "\u201cYou would be the first. Not sure why they\u2019re fighting about it, though. The decision won\u2019 t be up to them.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019 t?\u201d Wind gusts as dozens of dragons land on the opposite side of the first-years, rows of mage lights hanging between them. \u201cNothing about who dragons choose is up to humans,\u201d Kaori assures me. \u201cWe only like to maintain the illusion that we\u2019re in control. Something tells me they\u2019ve just been waiting for the others to make it back before they meet.\u201d \u201cThe leadership?\u201d My brow furrows. Kaori shakes his head. \u201cThe dragons.\u201d The dragons are going to meet? \u201cThank you for tending to my ankle. I\u2019d better get back over there.\u201d I offer him a tentative smile and head across the dimly lit field to Tairn and Andarna, feeling the weight of every stare in the valley as I stop and stand between the two dragons. \u201cYou two are causing a ruckus, you know .\u201d I look at Anda rna, then glance up at Tairn before turning around to face the field like the other first-years. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to let us do this.\u201d Oh shit, what if they make me choose? My stomach plummets.",
  "\u201cIt\u2019s up to the Empyr ean to decide,\u201d Tairn says, but there\u2019 s an edge of tension in his tone. \u201cDon\u2019 t leave the field. This might take a while.\u201d \u201cWhat might\u2014\u201d My question dies on my tongue as the biggest dragon I\u2019ve ever seen, even larger than Tairn, stalks toward us from the opening to the valle y. Each dragon it passes walks into the center of the field and follows after , gathering dozens as it walks. \u201cIs that\u2026\u201d \u201cCodagh,\u201d Tairn answers. General Melgren\u2019 s dragon. I make out the patchy holes in his battle-scarred wings as he comes closer , his golden gaze focused on Tairn in a way that makes me nauseous. He growls, low in his throat, turning those sinister eyes on me. Tairn rumbles his own growl, stepping forward so I\u2019m between his massive claws. There\u2019 s zero doubt I\u2019m the subject of both disgruntled snarls. \u201cYep! We\u2019re talking about you!\u201d Andarna says as the line passes by, and she joins. \u201cStay close to the wingleader until we r eturn,\u201d Tairn orders. Surely he meant to say squad leader . \u201cYou hear d what I said.\u201d Or not.",
  "I glance around and spot Xaden standing across the field, his arms crossed and legs spread as he stares at T airn.",
  "The riders are eerily silent as the dragons empty the meado w, taking flight in a steady stream near the end and landing halfway up the southernmost peak in a shadowy grouping I can barely define in the moonlight. The second the last of the dragons flies off, chaos erupts. First-yearsswarm the center of the field, where I happen to be standing, shouting in exuberance and searching for their friends. My eyes scan the crowd, hoping for some glimpse of\u2014 \u201cRhi!\u201d I shout, spotting Rhiannon in the mob and limping her way . \u201cViolet!\u201d She crushes me into a hug, pulling away when I wince at the fresh pain in my arm. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cTynan\u2019 s sword .\u201d I barely get the answer out of my mouth before I\u2019m snatched off my feet by Ridoc, who spins me around, my feet flying out in front of me. \u201cLook who rode in on the baddest motherfucker around!\u201d \u201cPut her down!\u201d Rhiannon chides. \u201cShe\u2019 s bleeding!\u201d \u201cOh shit, sorry ,\u201d Ridoc says, and my feet find the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d There\u2019 s fresh blood on the bandage, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve torn my stitches.",
  "And painkillers are awesome. \u201cAre you all right? Who did you guys bond?\u201d \u201cThe Green Daggertail!\u201d Rhiannon grins. \u201cFeir ge. And it was just\u2026 easy.\u201d She sighs. \u201cI saw her and just knew .\u201d \u201cAotrom,\u201d Ridoc says with pride. \u201cBrown Swordtail.\u201d \u201cSliseag!\u201d Sawyer throws his arms around Rhiannon\u2019 s and Ridoc\u2019 s shoulders. \u201cRed Swordtail!\u201d We all cheer , and I\u2019m swept into his hug next. Out of all of us, I\u2019m happiest for him, for all he\u2019 s had to endure to get here.",
  "\u201cTrina?\u201d I ask as he lets me go. One by one, they shake their heads, looking to the others for answers. An impossible heav iness settles in my heart, and I search for any other reason. \u201cI mean\u2026there\u2019 s a possibility she\u2019 s just unbonded, right?\u201d Sawyer shakes his head, sorrow slackening his shoulders. \u201cI saw her fall from the back of an Orange Clubtail.\u201d My heart sinks. \u201cTynan?\u201d Ridoc asks, his gaze jumping between us. \u201cTairn killed him,\u201d I say softly . \u201cIn his defense, T ynan had already run methrough once.\u201d I gesture to the wound on my arm. \u201cAnd he was trying to\u2014\u201d \u201cHe tried what ?\u201d I\u2019m spun around by the shoulde rs and yanked against a chest. Dain. My arms wind around his back and hold fast as I breathe deeply . \u201cDamn it. Violet.",
  "Just\u2026damn.\u201d He squeezes me tight, then pushes me to arm\u2019s length. \u201cY ou\u2019re hurt.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assure him, but that doesn\u2019 t quell the worry in his eyes. I\u2019m not sure anything ever will. \u201cBut we\u2019re all that\u2019s left of our squad\u2019 s first- years.\u201d Dain\u2019 s gaze rises to look at the others, and he nods. \u201cFour out of nine. That\u2019 s\u201d\u2014his jaw ticks once\u2014\u201cto be expected. The dragons are currently holding a meeting of the Empy rean\u2014their leadership. Stay here until they return,\u201d he says to the others before looking down at me. \u201cYou come with me.\u201d It\u2019s probably my mother , beckoning me through him. Surely she\u2019ll want to see me with everything that\u2019s going on. I glance across the field, but it\u2019s not Mom I find watching me but Xaden, his expression unreadable. When Dain takes my hand and tugs, I turn away from Xaden, following Dain to the opposite edge of the field, where we\u2019re hidden in shadow . Guess it\u2019s not about Mom. \u201cWhat the actual fuck happened out there?",
  "Because I\u2019ve got Cath telling me that not only did Tairn choo se you but so did the small one\u2014Adarn?\u201d His fingers lace with mine, panic swirling in his brown eyes. \u201cAndarna,\u201d I correct him, a smile playing on my lips at the thought of the small golden dragon. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make you choose.\u201d His expression hardens, and the certainty there makes me recoil. \u201cI\u2019m not choosing.\u201d I shake my head, disengaging our hands. \u201cNo human has ever chosen , and I\u2019m not about to be the first.\u201d And who the hell is Dain to tell me that?\u201cYou are.\u201d He rips his hand over his hair, and his composure slips. \u201cYou have to trust me. Y ou do trust me, right?\u201d \u201cOf course I do\u2014\u201d \u201cThen you have to choose Andarna.\u201d He nods as if his decree equals a decision made. \u201cThe gold one is the safest choice of the two.\u201d Why , because Tairn is\u2026T airn? Does Dain think I\u2019m too weak for a dragon as strong as T airn?",
  "My mouth opens, then shuts like a fish out of water as I search for any reply that isn\u2019t fuck off. There\u2019 s no way in hell I\u2019m rejecting Tairn. But my heart won\u2019 t let me reject Andarna, either . \u201cAre they going to make me choose?\u201d I think in their direction. There\u2019 s no response, and where I\u2019ve felt an\u2026extension in my mind, of who I am, stretc hing my mental boundaries since Tairn first spoke to me in that field, there\u2019 s nothing now . I\u2019m cut of f. Don\u2019 t panic. \u201cI\u2019m not choosing,\u201d I repeat, softer this time. What if I can\u2019t have either of them? What if they\u2019ve broken some sacred rule and now we\u2019ll all be punished?",
  "\u201cYou are. And it has to be Anda rna.\u201d He grips my shoulders and leans in, an edge of ur gency in his tone. \u201cI know she\u2019 s too small to bear a rider\u2014\u201d \u201cThat hasn\u2019 t been tested,\u201d I say defensively even though I know it\u2019s true. The physics just don\u2019 t match up. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019 t matter . It will mean that you won\u2019 t be able to ride with a wing, but they\u2019ll probably make you a permanent instructor here like Kaori.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s because his signet power makes him indispensable as a teacher , not because his dragon can\u2019t fly,\u201d I argue. \u201cAnd even he had the requisite four years with a combat wing before he was put behind a desk.\u201d Dain looks away , and I can almo st see the gears in his mind turning as he calculates\u2026what? My risk? My choice? My freedom? \u201cEven if you takeAndarna into combat, there\u2019 s only a chance you\u2019ll be killed. You take Tairn, and Xaden will get you killed. You think Melgren is terrifying?",
  "I\u2019ve been here for a year longer than you have, Vi. At least you know what you\u2019re getting when it comes to Melgren. Xaden isn\u2019t only twice as ruthless, but he\u2019s dangerously unpredictable.\u201d I blink. \u201cW ait. What are you saying?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re a mated pair, Tairn and Sgaeyl. The strongest bonded pair in centuries.\u201d My mind whirs . Mated pairs can\u2019t be separated for long or their health diminishes, so they\u2019re always stationed together .",
  "Always . Which means\u2014oh gods. \u201cJust\u2026tell me how it happened .\u201d He must see me fumbling because his voice softens. So I do. I tell him about Jack and his band of murderous friends hunting Andarna. I tell him about falling, and the field, and Xaden watching, Xaden\u2026shockingly protecting me with his warning when Oren was at my back. He had the perfect opportu nity to end me without it tipping his scales, and he chose to help. What the hell am I supposed to do with that? \u201cXaden was there,\u201d Dain says quietly , but the gentleness leaches from his voice. \u201cYes.\u201d I nod. \u201cBut he left after T airn showed up.\u201d \u201cXaden was there when you defended Andarna, and then Tairn just\u2026 showed up?\u201d he asks slowly . \u201cYes. That\u2019s what I just said.\u201d Was the timeline confusing him? \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t you see what happened? What Xaden\u2019 s done?\u201d His grip tightens. Thank gods for the dragon-scale armor , or I might have bruises tomorrow .",
  "\u201cPlease, do tell me what it is you think I\u2019ve done.\u201d A shape emerges from the shadows, and my pulse quickens as Xaden steps into the moonlight, darkness falling of f him like a discarded veil.Heat rushes through every vein, wakes every nerve ending. I hate the reaction of my body to the sight of him, but I can\u2019t deny it. His appeal is so fucking inconvenient. \u201cYou manipulate d Threshing.\u201d Dain\u2019 s hands drop from my shoulders, and he turns to face our wingleade r, the set of his shoulders rigid as he puts himself between us. Oh shit, that\u2019 s a huge allegation to hurl. \u201cDain, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d Paranoid . I sidestep Dain \u2019s back. If Xaden was going to kill me, he woul dn\u2019t have waited this long to do it. He\u2019s had every possible opportunity , and yet I\u2019m still standing here.",
  "Bonded. T o his dragon\u2019 s mate. Xaden\u2019 s not going to kill me. The realization makes my chest tighten, makes me reexamine everything that happened in that field, makes my sense of gravity shift beneath my feet. \u201cIs that an official accusation?\u201d Xaden looks at Dain like a hindrance, an annoyance. \u201cDid you step in?\u201d Dain demands. \u201cDid I what?\u201d Xaden arches a dark brow and levels a look on Dain that would make a lesser person wither . \u201cDid I see her outnumbered and already wounded? Did I think her bravery was as admirable as it was fucking reckless ?\u201d He turns that stare on me, and I feel the impact all the way to my toes. \u201cAnd I would do it again.\u201d I raise my chin. \u201cWell-the-fuck-aware,\u201d Xaden roars, losing his temper for the first time since I met him on Parapet. I pull in a quick breath, and Xaden does the same, as if he\u2019s just as shocked by his outburst as I am. \u201cDid I see her fight off three bigger cadets?\u201d His glare pivots to Dain.",
  "\u201cBecause the answer to all of those is yes. But you\u2019re asking the wrong question, Aetos. What you should be asking is if Sgaeyl saw it, too.\u201d Dain swallows and looks away , obviously rethinking his position.\u201cHis mate told him,\u201d I whisper . Sgaeyl called for T airn. \u201cShe\u2019 s never been a fan of bullies,\u201d Xaden says to me. \u201cBut don\u2019t mistake it as an act of kindness toward you. She\u2019s fond of the little dragon.",
  "Unfortunately , Tairn chose you all on his own.\u201d \u201cFuck,\u201d Dain mutters. \u201cMy thought exactly .\u201d Xaden shakes his head at Dain. \u201cSorreng ail is the last person on the Continent I\u2019d ever want to be chained to me. I didn\u2019 t do this.\u201d Ouch . It takes all the willpower in my body not to reach for my chest and make sure he didn\u2019 t just rip my heart out from behind my ribs, which makes absolutely zero sense, since I feel the same way about him. He\u2019s the son of the Great Betrayer . His father was directly responsible for Brennan\u2019 s death. \u201cAnd even if I had.\u201d Xaden moves toward Dain, towering over him. \u201cWould you really level that accusation knowing it would have been what saved the woman you call your best friend?\u201d My gaze flies to Dain, and a silent, damning moment passes. It\u2019s a simple question, and yet I find myself holding my breath for his answer . What do I really mean to him?",
  "\u201cThere are\u2026rules.\u201d Dain tilts his chin to look Xaden in the eyes. \u201cAnd out of curiosity , would you have, let\u2019s say, bent those rules to save your precious little Violet in that field?\u201d His voice ices over as he studies Dain\u2019 s expression with rapt fascination. Xaden had taken a step. Right before Tairn landed, he\u2019d moved\u2026toward me. Dain\u2019 s jaw flexes, and I see the war in his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019 s unfair to ask him.\u201d I move to Dain\u2019 s side as the sound of whipping wings interrupts the night.",
  "The dragons are flying back. They\u2019ve made their decision. \u201cI\u2019m ordering you to answer , squad leader .\u201d Xaden doesn\u2019 t even spare me a glance.Dain swallows, his eyes slamming shut. \u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019 t have.\u201d My heart hits the ground. I\u2019ve always known deep down that Dain valued rule and order more than relationships, more than me, but to have it so cruelly displayed cuts deeper than T ynan\u2019 s sword. Xaden scof fs. Dain immediate ly jerks his head toward mine. \u201cIt would have killed me to watch something happen to you, V i, but the rules\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I force out, touching his shoulder , but it isn\u2019 t. \u201cThe dragons are returning,\u201d Xaden says as the first of them lands on the illuminated field. \u201cGet back to formation, squad leader .\u201d Dain rips his gaze from mine and walks away , blending into the crowd of hurried riders and their dragons. \u201cWhy would you do that to him?\u201d I hurl at Xaden, then shake my head. I don\u2019t care why.",
  "\u201cForget it,\u201d I mutter, then march off, heading back toward the spot where T airn told me to wait. \u201cBecause you put too much faith in him,\u201d Xaden answers anyway , catching up to me without even lengthening his stride. \u201cAnd knowing who to trust is the only thing that will keep you alive\u2014keep us alive\u2014not only in the quadrant but after graduation.\u201d \u201cThere is no us,\u201d I say, dodging a rider as she races past.",
  "Dragons land left and right, the ground trembling with the force of the riot\u2019s movement. I\u2019ve never seen so many dragons at flight in the same moment. \u201cOh, I think you\u2019ll find that\u2019 s no longer the case,\u201d Xaden murmurs next to me, gripping my elbow and yanking me out of the path of another rider running from the other direction. Yesterday , he would have let me run headfirst into him. Hell, he might have even pushed me. \u201cTairn\u2019s bonds are so powerful, both to mate and rider, because he\u2019s so powerful. Losing his last rider nearly killed him, which, in turn, nearly killed Sgaeyl. Mated pairs\u2019 lives are\u2014\u201d\u201cInterdependent, I know that.\u201d We move forward until we\u2019re dead center in the line of riders. If I wasn\u2019 t so aggravated by Xaden\u2019 s callous attitude toward Dain, I would take the time to admire just how spectac ular it is to see hundreds of dragons land all around us. Or maybe I\u2019d question how the man next to me manages to consume all the air in the massive field.",
  "\u201cEach time a dragon chooses a rider, that bond is stronger than the last, which means that if you die, Violence, it sets off a chain of events that potentially ends with me dying, too.\u201d His expression is immovable marble, but the anger in his eyes leaves me breathless. It\u2019s pure\u2026rage. \u201cSo yeah, unfortunately for everyone involved, there\u2019 s now an us if the Empyrean lets Tairn\u2019s choice stand.\u201d Oh. Gods.",
  "I\u2019m tethered to Xaden Riorson. \u201cAnd now that Tairn is in play, that other cadets know he\u2019s willing to bond\u2026\u201d He sighs, annoyance rippling over his features, his strong jaw working as he looks away . \u201cThat\u2019 s why Tairn told me to stay with you,\u201d I whisper as the consequences of today\u2019 s actions settle in my churning stomach. \u201cBecause of the unbonded.\u201d There are at least three dozen of them standing on the opposite side of the field, watch ing us with avarice in their eyes\u2014including Oren Seifert. \u201cThe unbonded are going to try to kill you in hopes they\u2019ll get Tairn to bond them .\u201d Xaden shakes his head at Garrick as he approaches, and the section leader glances between us, his mouth set in a firm line before retreating across the field. \u201cTairn is one of the strongest dragons on the Continent, and the vast power he channels is about to be yours. The next few months, the unbonded will try to kill a newly paired rider while the bond is weak, while they still have a chance of that dragon changing its mind and picking them so they\u2019re not set back a full year. And for Tairn? They\u2019ll do just about anything.\u201d He sighs again like it\u2019s his new full-timejob.",
  "\u201cThere are forty-one unbonded riders for which you are now target number one.\u201d He holds up a single finger .",
  "\u201cAnd Tairn thinks you\u2019ll play bodyguard.\u201d I snort. \u201cLittle does he know just how much you dislike me.\u201d \u201cHe knows exactly how much I value my own life,\u201d Xaden retorts, glancing down my body . \u201cYou\u2019re freakishly calm for someone who just heard she\u2019 s about to be hunted.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a typical Wednesday for me.\u201d I shrug, ignoring the way his gaze heats my skin. \u201cAnd honestly , being hunted by forty-one people is a lot less intimidating than constantly watching dark corners for you.\u201d A breeze hits my back as Andar na lands behind me, followed by a gust of wind and shuddering ground when it\u2019 s Tairn. Without another word, Xaden rips his gaze from mine and walks away , cutting a slightly diagonal path across the field to where Sgaeyl overshadows the other wingleaders\u2019 dragons. \u201cTell me it\u2019 s going to be all right,\u201d I murmur toward Andarna and T airn. \u201cIt is how it should be,\u201d Tairn answers, his voice gruff and bored at the same time. \u201cYou didn\u2019 t answer befor e.\u201d Fine, it sounds a little accusatory . \u201cHumans can\u2019t know what\u2019 s said within the Empyr ean,\u201d Andarna answers. \u201cIt\u2019s a rule.\u201d So every rider was blocked, not just me.",
  "The thought is oddly comforting. Also, the whole Empyr ean is a new term for me today . Kaori must be in heaven tonight with all the dragon politics coming to light. What did they decide? I glance at my mother , but she\u2019 s looking everywhere but my direction. General Melgren moves toward the front of the dais, his uniform dripping in medals. Dain\u2019 s right in one way\u2014the top general in our kingdom is terrifying. He\u2019s never had an issue using infantry for fodder , and his cruel ty when it come s to overseeing the interrogation\u2014and execution\u2014ofprisoners is well-known, at least at my family\u2019 s dining room table. His enormous nightmare of a dragon takes up the entire space beside the dais, and a hush falls over the crowd as Melgren angles his hands in front of his face. \u201cCodagh has relayed that the dragons have spoken regarding the Sorrengail girl.\u201d Lesser magic allows his voice to magically amplify over the field for all to hear .",
  "Woman , I mentally correct him, my stomach knotting. \u201cWhile tradition has shown us that there is one rider for every dragon, there has never been a case of two dragons selecting the same rider, and therefore there is no dragon law against it,\u201d he declares. \u201cWhile we riders may not feel as though this is\u2026equitable\u201d\u2014his tone implies that he\u2019s one of them\u2014 \u201cdragons make their own laws. Both Tairn and\u2026\u201d He looks over his shou lder and his aide rushe s forward to whisper in his ear. \u201cAndarna have chosen V iolet Sorrengail, and so their choice stands.\u201d The crow d murmurs, but my shoulders sag in acute relief. I don\u2019t have to make an impossible choice.",
  "\u201cAs it should be,\u201d Tairn grumbles. \u201cHumans have no say in the laws of dragons.\u201d Mom steps forward and makes the same gesture with her hands to project her voice, but I can\u2019t concentrat e on what she\u2019s saying as she closes out the formal portion of the Threshing ceremony , promising the unbonded riders another chance next year. If they don\u2019t manage to kill one of us while our bonds are weak in the next few months and try to bond our dragons themselves. I belong to Tairn and Andarna\u2026and, in some really fucked-up way\u2026 Xaden. My scalp prickles, and I glance across the field at him. As if sensing my gaze, he looks over and holds up a single finger. Target number one .\u201cWelcome to a family that knows no boundaries, no limits, and no end,\u201d my mother finishes, and a cheer resounds around the field. \u201cRiders, step forward.\u201d I look left and right in confusion, but so does every other rider . \u201cFive steps or so,\u201d Tairn says.",
  "I take them. \u201cDragons, it is our honor as always,\u201d Mom calls out. \u201cNow we celebrate!\u201d Heat blasts my back, and I hiss in pain as riders on both sides of me cry out. My back feels like it\u2019 s on fucking fire, and yet everyo ne across the field is cheering raucously , some of them racing our way . Other riders are caught up in embraces. \u201cYou\u2019ll like it,\u201d Tairn promises. \u201cIt\u2019s unique.\u201d The pain fades to a dull ache, and I glance over my shoulder . There\u2019 s a solid black\u2026 something peeking out from the vest. \u201cI\u2019ll like what?\u201d \u201cViolet!\u201d Dain reaches me, his smile wide as he cups my face. \u201cYou kept both of them!\u201d \u201cI guess I did.\u201d My lips curve. It\u2019 s all\u2026surreal, all too much for one day . \u201cWhere\u2019 s your\u2026 \u201d He lets go and circles me. \u201cCan I unlace this? Just the top?\u201d he asks, tugging at the raised neck of the back of my vest. I nod. A few pushes and pulls later, the crisp October air nips at the base of my neck.",
  "\u201cHoly shit. Y ou have to see this.\u201d \u201cTell the boy to move,\u201d Tairn orders. \u201cTairn says you should move.\u201d Dain steps out of the way . Suddenly , my vision isn\u2019t mine. I\u2019m looking at my own back through\u2026 Andarna\u2019 s eyes. A back that has a glistening black relic of a dragon mid- flight stretching from shoulder to shoulder and, in the center , the silhouette of a shimmering golden one.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I whisper . I\u2019m marked by their magic as a rider now, as their rider . \u201cWe know ,\u201d Andarna answers . I blink, and my vision is mine again, and Dain\u2019 s hands lace up my corset quickly , then are on my face, tipping it up toward his. \u201cYou have to know that I would do anything to save you, Violet, to keep you safe,\u201d he blurts, panic in his eyes. \u201cWhat Riorson said\u2026\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI know ,\u201d I say reassuringly , nodding even as something cracks in my heart. \u201cYou always want me safe.\u201d He\u2019d do anything. Except break the rules.",
  "\u201cYou have to know how I feel about you.\u201d His thumb strokes over my cheek, his eyes searching for something, and then his mouth is on mine. His lips are soft, but the kiss is firm, and delight races up my spine. After years, Dain is finally kissing me. The thrill is gone in less than a heartbeat. There\u2019 s no heat. No energy. No sharp slice of lust. Disappointment sours the moment, but not for Dain. He\u2019 s all smiles as he pulls away . It was over in an instant. It was everything I\u2019ve ever wanted\u2026except\u2026 Shit. I don\u2019 t want it anymore.It is ther efore only natural that the mor e powerful the dragon, the more powerful the signet its rider manifests.

I\u2019ll never take the luxury of privacy for granted again.",
  "I close my door behind me as I limp into the hallway . Rhiannon\u2019 s door, across the small hall from mine, opens and I see Sawyer \u2019s tall, lean frame come out. He runs his fingers through his hair , and when he sees me, his eyebrows rise and he freezes\u2014his cheeks almost as red as his freckles. \u201cGood morning.\u201d I grin. \u201cViolet.\u201d He forces an awkward smile and walks off, headed toward the main hallway of the first-year dormitory . A coupl e from Second Wing holds hands as they come out of the room next to Rhianno n\u2019s, and I offer them a smile as I lean back against my door and wait, testing my ankle by rolling it. It\u2019s sore, just like every time I sprain it, but the brace and my boot hold it in place well enough to keep my weight on it. If I were anywhere else, I would call for crutch es, but that would just put another target on my back, and according to Xaden, I already have a big enough one as it is.Rhiannon walks out of her room and smiles as soon as she sees me.",
  "\u201cNo more breakfast duty?\u201d \u201cI was told last night that all the less desirable duties were being handed off to the unbonded so our energy can be redirected for flight lessons.\u201d Which means I\u2019ll have to find another way to weaken my opponents before challenges.",
  "Xaden\u2019s right. I can\u2019t always count on taking every enemy down with poiso n, but I\u2019m not going to ignore the only advantage I have here, either . \u201cOne more reason for the unbonded to hate us,\u201d Rhiannon mutters. \u201cSo, Sawyer, huh, Rhi?\u201d We start down our hallway , passing a few other rooms before meeting up with the main corridor that leads to the rotunda. Have to say , the first-year rooms aren\u2019 t as spacious as the second-years\u2019, but at least we both got ones with windows. A grin curves her lips. \u201cI felt like celebrating.\u201d She darts a quick side-eye at me. \u201cAnd why have I not heard of you celebrating?\u201d We melt into the crowd moving toward the gathering hall. \u201cHaven\u2019 t found anyone I want to celebrate with.\u201d \u201cReally? Becau se I heard that you and a certain squad leader had a moment last night.\u201d My gaze whips toward hers, and I nearly stumble over my feet. \u201cCome on, Vi. The entire quadrant was out there, and you don\u2019t think someone saw you?\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a lecture from me. Who gives a shit if it\u2019s frowned upon to be in a relationship with a superior officer?",
  "There\u2019 s no regulation, and it\u2019s not like any of us is guaranteed to live through the day .\u201d \u201cSolid points,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut it\u2019s\u2026\u201d I shake my head, searchin g for the right words. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that with us. I\u2019d always hoped it would be, but when he kissed me\u2014there was nothing there. Like. Nothing .\u201d It\u2019s impossible to keep the disappointment out of my voice. \u201cWell, that\u2019s shitty to hear.\u201d She hooks her arm through mine. \u201cI\u2019msorry .\u201d \u201cMe too.\u201d I sigh. A door opens farther down the hall, and Liam Mairi walks out with his arm wrapped around the waist of another first-year who bond ed a Brown Clubtail. Looks like everyone was celebrating last night except me.",
  "\u201cGood morning, ladies.\u201d Ridoc forces his way through the crowd and slings an arm around each of our shoulders as we enter the rotunda. \u201cOr should I say , riders ?\u201d \u201cI like the soun d of riders ,\u201d Rhiannon replies, shooting a smile in his direction. \u201cIt has a certain ring to it,\u201d Ridoc agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely better than dead . Where\u2019 s your relic?\u201d I ask Ridoc as we pass through the columns of carved dragons and take the steps into commons. \u201cRight here.\u201d His arm falls off my shoulders, and he shoves the sleeve of his tunic up to reveal the brown mark of a dragon silhouette on his upper arm. \u201cY ou?\u201d \u201cCan\u2019 t see it. It\u2019 s on my back.\u201d \u201cThat will keep you safer if you\u2019re ever separated from that massive dragon of yours .\u201d His eyes dance. \u201cI swear , I thought I was going to shit myself when I saw him on the field. What about yours, Rhi?\u201d \u201cSomewhere you\u2019ll never see,\u201d she responds. \u201cYou wound me.\u201d He slaps his hand over his heart. \u201cI highly doubt that,\u201d she retorts, but there\u2019 s a smile on her face. We move through commons and into the gathering hall, then make our way through the line for breakfast.",
  "It\u2019s odd to be on this side of it, and I startle at the sight of the guy behind the counter . It\u2019s Oren. He glares at me with a hatred that trickles like ice down my spine. I skiphis station, opting for fresh fruit that I know can\u2019t be tampered with, just in case he decides to take my approach to conflict and poison me. \u201cAsshole,\u201d Ridoc mutters behin d me. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe they tried to kill you.\u201d \u201cI can.\u201d I shrug , taking my chances with a mug of apple juice. \u201cI\u2019m the weakest link, right? Unfortunately for me, that means people are bound to try and take me out for the good of the wing.\u201d We head toward the Fourth Wing section and find a table with three extra seats. \u201cMind if we\u2014\u201d Ridoc starts. \u201cAbsolutely! It\u2019s yours!\u201d A couple of guys from Tail Section scurry off the bench. \u201cSorry , Sorrengail!\u201d the other says over his shoulder as they find another table, leaving this one empty . What the hell? \u201cWell, that was really fucking weird.\u201d Rhiannon rounds the other side of the table , and I follow , putting our backs to the wall as we step over the bench and sit, setting our trays in front of us.",
  "I\u2019m half tempted to give my underarms a whif f to see if I smell. \u201cEven weirder?\u201d Ridoc remark s, gesturing across the hall toward First Wing. Following his line of sight, my eyebrows lift. Jack Barlowe is being squeezed out of his table. He\u2019 s forced to stand as others take his seat. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Rhiannon bites into a pear and chews. Jack moves to another table\u2014whose occupants won\u2019 t make room for him \u2014and then finds a place two tables down. \u201cHow the mighty have fallen,\u201d Ridoc notes, watching the same show I am, but there\u2019 s no satisfaction in watching Jack struggle.",
  "Feral dogs bite harder when they\u2019re cornered. \u201cHey , Sorrengail,\u201d the stocky girl from First Wing I beat in my second challenge says with a tight smile as she walks past our table.\u201cHi.\u201d I wave awkwardly as she walks away , then turn to whisper to Ridoc and Rhia nnon. \u201cShe hasn\u2019 t spoken to me since I took one of her daggers in that challenge.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s because you bonded Tairn.\u201d Imogen blows her pink hair out of her face and throws her leg over the bench across from us to sit, pushing up the sleeves of her tunic and revealing her rebellion relic. \u201cThe morning after Threshing is always a clusterf uck. Power balance shifts, and you, little Sorrengail, are now about to be the most powerful rider in the quadrant.",
  "Anyone with common sense is going to be scared of you.\u201d I blink, my pulse elevating. Is that what\u2019 s going on? I look around the hall and take note. Social groups have split up, and some of the cadets I would have considered threats are no longer sitting where they usually do. \u201cWhich is why you\u2019r e now sitting with us?\u201d Rhiannon arches a brow at the second-year . \u201cBecause I can count on one hand the number of nice words you\u2019ve said to any of us.\u201d She holds up a fist with zero fingers raised. Quinn\u2014the tall second-year in our squad who hasn\u2019 t bothered to so much as look our way since Parapet\u2014takes a seat next to Imogen, and Sawyer arrives, sitting on Rhiannon\u2019 s other side. Quinn tucks her blond curls behind her ears and brushes her bangs out of her eyes, her round cheeks rising as she smiles at something Imogen says. Have to admit, the hooped piercings that line the shells of both her ears are pretty awesome, and among her half dozen patches, it\u2019s the dark-green one\u2014the same color as her eyes\u2014with two silhouettes that\u2019s most intriguing. I should have studied up on what all the patches mean, but according to what I\u2019ve heard, they change every year .",
  "I\u2019m personally a fan of the first ones we\u2019ve been given. I had to sew the flame-shaped patch with the emblem for Fourth Wing and the centered, reddish number two with great care, being sure to only stitch the fabric of my corseted armor , since it\u2019s not like any needle is going to penetrate the scales. My favorite patch, though, is the one beside the Flame Section one.We\u2019re the squad to have the most surviving members since Parapet, this year\u2019s Iron Squad. \u201cYou weren\u2019 t interesting enoug h to sit with before,\u201d Imogen responds, then bites into a muf fin. \u201cI usually sit with my girlfriend in Claw Section. Besides, no use getting to know you when most of you die,\u201d Quinn adds, tucking her curls away again, just to have them spring forward. \u201cNo of fense.\u201d \u201cNone taken?\u201d I start on my apple. I nearly spit it out when Heaton and Emery , the only third-yea rs in our squad, flank Imogen and Quinn on the bench across from us. The only people we\u2019re missing are Dain and Cianna, who are eating with leadership as usual. \u201cI thought Seifert would bond,\u201d Heaton says to Emery across the table, as though we\u2019ve caught them mid-discussion. The normally red flames in their hair are green today .",
  "\u201cOther than losing to Sorrengail, he nailed every challenge.\u201d \u201cHe tried to kill Andarna.\u201d Shit. Maybe I should have kept that to myself. Every head at the table turns toward me. \u201cMy guess would be that T airn told the others.\u201d I shrug. \u201cBut Barlowe bonded?\u201d Ridoc questions. \u201cThough from what I\u2019ve heard, his Orange Scorpiontail is on the smaller side.\u201d \u201cShe is,\u201d Quinn confirms. \u201cWhich is why he\u2019 s struggling this morning.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t worry\u2014I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll make up for his lack of social standing in other ways,\u201d Rhiannon mutters, her gaze narrowing on my tray. \u201cYou have to have some protein, V i. You can\u2019 t just survive on fruit.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the only food I can be sure isn\u2019t tampered with, especially with Oren behind the counter .\u201d I busy myself with peeling an orange. \u201cOh, for fuck\u2019 s sake.\u201d Imogen scrapes three pieces of sausage onto my plate. \u201cShe\u2019s right. You\u2019re going to need all your strength to ride, especially with a dragon as big as T airn.\u201dI stare at the sausage.",
  "Imogen hates me just as much as Oren does. Hell, she\u2019s the one who broke my arm and ripped out my shoulder on assessment day. \u201cYou can trust her ,\u201d Tairn says, and I startle, dropping the orange. \u201cShe hates me.\u201d \u201cStop arguing with me and eat something.\u201d There\u2019s zero room for debate in his tone. My gaze rises to meet Imogen\u2019 s, and she tilts her head, starin g back in challenge. I use my fork to cut the link, then pop it into my mouth and chew , focusing on the conversation at the table again. \u201cWhat\u2019 s your signet?\u201d Rhiannon asks Emery . Air rushes down the table, rattling the glasses. Air manipulation. Got it.",
  "\u201cThat\u2019 s epic.\u201d Ridoc\u2019 s eyes widen. \u201cHow much air can you move?\u201d \u201cNone of your business.\u201d He barely spares him a glance. \u201cSorrengail, after class is out today , you\u2019re mine,\u201d Imogen says. I swallow my current bite. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Her pale green eyes lock on mine. \u201cMeet me in the sparring gym.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m already working with her on sparring\u2014\u201d Rhiannon starts. \u201cGood. We can\u2019t afford her to lose any challenges,\u201d Imogen retorts. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to help you with weights. We need to strengthen the muscles around your joints before chall enges resume. That\u2019 s the only way you\u2019ll survive.\u201d The hairs rise on the back of my neck. \u201cAnd since when do you care about my survival?\u201d This isn\u2019t a squad thing. It can\u2019t be. Not when she didn\u2019 t give a shit before. \u201cSince now,\u201d she says, gripping her fork in her fist, but it\u2019s the lightning- fast glance toward the dais at the end of the hall that gives her away . Her concern isn\u2019t coming from the goodness of her heart. Somethi ng tells me it\u2019s an order . \u201cSquads are about to be condensed at morning formation.We\u2019ll be down to two in every section,\u201d she continues. \u201c",
  "Aetos kept the highest number of his first-years alive\u2014hence the patch\u2014so he \u2019 ll be allowed to retain his squad , but we \u2019 ll probably gain a few when they strip the squads from those who weren \u2019 t as successful. \u201d As discreetly as I can , I look to my right , past the other Fourth Wing tables and to the dais where Xaden sits with his executive officer and the section leaders , including Garrick , whose shoulders look like they should take up at least two seats . It\u2019s Garrick who looks my way first, his forehead lining with\u2026 What is that? W orry?",
  "Then he looks away . The only reason he\u2019d be remotely worried\u2014 he knows. He knows my fate is tethered to Xaden\u2019 s. My gaze snaps to Xaden, and my chest tightens. So. Freaking. Beautiful. Apparently my body doesn\u2019 t care that he\u2019s as dangerous as they come in the quadrant, because heat rushes through my veins, flushing my skin. He\u2019s using a dagger to peel an apple, removing the rind in one long curl, and the blade continues its path as his eyes lift, locking with mine. My whole head tingles. Gods, is there any part of my body that doesn\u2019 t physically react to the sight of him? He glances towa rd Imogen and back to me, and that\u2019s all it takes for me to know for certain. He\u2019s ordered her to help train me.",
  "Xaden Riorson is now in the business of keeping his mortal enemy alive. \u2026 A few hours later, after the squads are rearranged and the death roll is read, all the first-year riders in Fourth Wing stand in our newly issued flight leathers, waiting in front of our dragons on the flight field. The uniform is thicker than our usual one, with a full jacket I\u2019ve buttoned over my dragon- scale armor . And unlike our regular uniforms, whatever we choose them to be, flightleathers bear no insignia besides our rank at our shoulder and any leadership desig nation. No names. No patches. Nothing that could give us away if we\u2019re separated from our dragons behind enemy lines. Just a lot of sheaths for weapons.",
  "I try not to think about possibly fighting in the war effort one day and focus on the organized chaos evolving on the flight field this morning. I can\u2019t miss the way the other cadets look at Tairn or the wide berth the other dragons give him. Honestly , if I had those teeth bared at me, I\u2019d back away , too. \u201cNo you woul dn\u2019t, because you didn\u2019 t. You stayed and defended Andarna.\u201d His voice fills my head, and I can tell from his tone there are places he\u2019d rather be. \u201cOnly because there was a lot going on at the moment,\u201d I respond. \u201cAndarna isn\u2019 t coming this morning?\u201d \u201cShe has no need for flight lessons when she can\u2019 t bear you.\u201d \u201cGood point.\u201d Though it would have been nice to see her. She\u2019s quieter in my head, too, not as meddlesome as T airn. \u201cI hear d that. Now pay attention.\u201d I roll my eyes but focus on what Kaori is saying from the center of the field. His hand is up, using common lesser magic to project his voice so we can all hear .",
  "God help us when Ridoc figures out how to do that. I bite back a smile, knowing he\u2019ll find some way to annoy the shit out of every rider in the quadrant, not just his squad. \u201c\u2026and at only ninety-two riders, you are our smallest class to date.\u201d My shou lders dip. \u201cI thought a hundr ed and one were willing to bond, plus you?\u201d \u201cWilling doesn\u2019 t mean they found worthy riders,\u201d Tairn answers. \u201cAnd yet two of you chose me?\u201d With forty-one unbonded? That\u2019 s quite the insult.\u201cYou\u2019re worthy . At least I think you are, but you appar ently don\u2019t pay attention in class.\u201d He chuffs and a warm puff of steam blasts the back of my neck. \u201cThere are forty-one unbonded riders who would kill to be standing where you are,\u201d Kaori continues. \u201cAnd your dragons know that your bond is at its weakest point right now, so if you fall, if you fail, there\u2019 s a good chance your dragon might let you if it thinks the unbonded will be a better choice.\u201d \u201cComforting,\u201d I mutter . Tairn makes a noise that reminds me of a scof f. \u201cNow , we\u2019re going to mount, then follow a series of specific maneuvers your dragons already know . Your orders are simple today .",
  "Stay in your seat,\u201d Kaori finishes. Then he turns and breaks into a sprint, racing the dozen feet toward his dragon\u2019 s foreleg and making the vertic al climb to mount. Just like the last obstacle on the Gauntlet. I swallow , wishing I hadn\u2019 t eaten so much for breakfast, and turn to face Tairn. To my left and right, other riders are doing the same mounting maneuver . There\u2019 s no way I can pull that off normally , let alone with my ankle still healing. Tairn dips his shoulder and makes his leg into a ramp for me. Defeat just about swallows me whole. I\u2019ve bonded the biggest\u2014and certainly grumpiest\u2014dragon in the quadrant, and yet he has to make accommodations for me. \u201cThey\u2019r e accom modations for me.",
  "I\u2019ve seen your memories. I\u2019m not about to have you sticking daggers into my leg to climb up. Now let\u2019 s go.\u201d I snort but make the ascent, shaking my head as I navigate his spikes to find the seat. My thighs ache from yesterday , and I wince as I get into position, gripping the pommel of scales. Kaori\u2019 s dragon launches into the sky .\u201cHold tight.\u201d I feel the same bands of energy clamp around my legs, and Tairn crouches a millisecond before he hurls us skyward. The wind tears at my eyes as my stomach falls away , and I risk holding on with one hand to lower my flight goggles. Immediate relief. \u201cWe had to go second?\u201d I ask Tairn as we fly out of the canyon and higher into the mountain range. I get it now, why I didn\u2019 t see the dragons training often even though I\u2019ve basically grown up at Basgiat h.

Good to know .",
  "Remind me to spend some time at temple so I can make multiple appeals to Dunne.\u201d I keep my focus on Kaori, watching for when the maneuvers will start. \u201cThe goddess of str ength and war?\u201d Tairn clearly scof fs this time. \u201cWhat, dragons don\u2019t think we need the gods on our side?\u201d Shit, it\u2019s cold up here. My gloved hands tighten on the pommel. \u201cDragons pay no heed to your puny gods.\u201d Kaori banks right, and Tairn follows suit, leading us into a steep dive down the face of one of the peaks. I clench with my legs, but I know it\u2019s Tairn keeping me in the seat. He holds me there through another climb and even a near-spiral of a turn, and I can\u2019t help but notice that he\u2019s taking everything Kaori is doing and making it harder . \u201cYou can\u2019 t hold me her e the entir e time, you know .\u201d \u201cWatch me. Unless you\u2019d rather be scraped off the glacier below like Gleann\u2019 s rider back ther e?\u201d I whip my head around to look, but all I see is Tairn\u2019s tail swinging, his massive spikes blocking the view . \u201cDon\u2019 t look.\u201d\u201cWe already lost a rider?\u201d My throat knots. \u201cGleann chose poorly .",
  "He never bonds str ongly anyway .\u201d Oh. My . God. \u201cIf you keep holding me like this, your energy will go into keeping me on instead of channeling when we need power for battle,\u201d I argue. \u201cIt\u2019s a minuscule amount of my power .\u201d How the hell am I supposed to be a rider if I can\u2019t stay on my damn dragon by myself? \u201cHave it your way .\u201d The bands fall away . \u201cThank yoooooh shit!\u201d He bank s left and my thighs slip. My hands slide. I skid right of f his side, my fingers fumbling for purchase and finding none. Rushing air fills my ears as I plummet toward the glacier , raw fear gripping my heart and squeezin g like a vise. The shape of a body below grows bigger and bigger . I\u2019m yanked upward as Tairn\u2019s claws catch me, harnessing me just like he did during Threshing. He climbs high, then tosses me again, but at least I\u2019m prepared for impact this time as his back rises to meet my falling bottom. There\u2019 s a disgusted roar of something I don\u2019 t understand in my head. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d I scramble for the seat and get myself into position as he flies level. \u201cThe closest translation for humans is probably \u2018for fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019 Now.",
  "Are you going to stay in your seat this time?\u201d He dips back into formation, and I manage to stay on. \u201cI have to be able to do this by myself. We both need me to do this,\u201d I argue. \u201cStubborn silver human,\u201d Tairn mutters, following Kaori into a dive. I fall again. And again. And again.\u2026 Later that evening, after dinner , I make my way to the sparring gym. Everything hurts from how many times I slid off Tairn\u2019s back, and I\u2019m pretty sure there are bruises under my arms from him catching me. I\u2019m through the rotunda and crossing into the academic wing when I hear Dain calling my name, jogging to catch up with me. I wait for that familiar swell of happiness that we might have a minute alone, but it doesn\u2019 t come. Instead, there\u2019 s a sea of awkwardness that I don\u2019 t know how to navigate. What the hell is wrong with me? Dain is gorgeous and kind and a really , really good man. He\u2019s honorable and my very best friend. So why don\u2019t we have any chemistry?",
  "\u201cRhiannon said you were headed this way,\u201d he says once he reaches my side, concern knitting his brow . \u201cI\u2019m going to work out.\u201d I force a smile as we turn the corner where the gym is just ahead of us, the lar ge arched doors open. \u201cYou didn\u2019 t get enough during flight today?\u201d He touches my shoulder and stops, so I do, too, pivoting to face him in the empty hallway . \u201cI defini tely fell enough today .\u201d I check the bandage on my arm. At least I didn\u2019 t tear open my stitches. His jaw works. \u201cI honestly thought you\u2019d be all right once Tairn chose you.\u201d \u201cAnd I will be,\u201d I assure him, my voice rising. \u201cI just need to strengthen my muscles to stay seated through maneuvers, and Tairn insists on making everything harder than what Kaori is doing.\u201d \u201cFor your own good.\u201d \u201cAre you always ar ound?\u201d I snap back mentally . \u201cYes. Get used to it.\u201d I fight the ur ge to growl at the intrusive, overbearing\u2014 \u201cStill her e.\u201d\u201cViolet?\u201d Dain asks. \u201cSorry , I\u2019m not used to T airn butting into my thoughts.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign. Means your bond is strengthening. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure why he\u2019s giving you a hard time with maneuvers.",

T ell him to ease up on you.\u201d \u201cTell him to mind his own business. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026uh\u2026do that.\u201d I bite back a laugh. \u201cTake it easy on him. He\u2019s my best friend.\u201d Tairn snorts. A sigh rips from Dain\u2019 s lips, and he palms my face gently , his gaze dropping to my lips for a heartb eat before he steps back. \u201cLook . About last night\u2026\u201d \u201cThe part where you told me Xaden would get me killed if I bonded Tairn? Or the part where you kissed me?\u201d I fold my arms across my chest, careful with my right. \u201cThe kiss,\u201d he admits, his voice lowering. \u201cIt\u2026it never should have happened.\u201d Relief courses through me. \u201cRight?\u201d I crack a smile.",
  "Thank gods he feels the same way . \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019 t mean we\u2019re not friends.\u201d \u201cThe best of friends,\u201d he agrees , but his eyes are heavy with a sadness I don\u2019t understand. \u201cAnd it\u2019 s not that I don\u2019 t want you\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d My eyebrows rise. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Are our wires somehow crossed? \u201cI\u2019m saying the same thing you are.\u201d Two lines appear between his brows. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frowned upon to have a physical relationship with anyone in our chain of command.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Y eah, that definitely isn\u2019t what I\u2019m saying. \u201cAnd you know how hard I\u2019ve worked to be a squad leader . I\u2019m determined to be a wingleader next year, and as much as you mean tome\u2026\u201d He shakes his head. Oh. This is all abou t politics for him.",
  "\u201cRight.\u201d I nod slowly . \u201cI get it.\u201d It shouldn\u2019 t matter that the only reason he isn\u2019t pursuing me is rank, and it honestly doesn\u2019 t. But it definitely makes me lose a little respect for him, which is something I never expected. \u201cAnd maybe next year, if you\u2019re in a different wing, or even after graduation,\u201d he starts, hope lighting up his eyes. \u201cSorrengail, let\u2019s go. I am not sitting around all night,\u201d Imogen calls from the doorway, her arms folded across her chest. \u201cIf our squad leader is done with you, that is.\u201d Dain rears back, glancing between Imogen and me. \u201cShe\u2019 s training you?\u201d \u201cShe of fered.\u201d I shrug. \u201cSquad loyalty and all that. Blah, blah.\u201d Imogen offers a smile that doesn\u2019 t reach her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019 t worry . I\u2019ll take good care of her. Bye, Aetos.\u201d I toss Dain a quick smile and walk away , refusing to look over my shoulder to see if he\u2019s still there. She quickly follows after me, then leads me towa rd the corner on the left where glass meets stone and pushes open a door I\u2019ve never taken the time to notice before.",
  "The room is lit with mage lights and full of a variety of wooden machinery with racks and ropes and pulleys, benches with levers, and bars attached to the wall.",
  "And on the other side, doing push-ups on a mat, is one of the first-year Tyrs I saw in the woods that night, Garrick crouched down next to her, urging her on. \u201cDon\u2019 t worry , Sorrengail,\u201d Imogen coos in a saccharine-sweet tone. \u201cThere\u2019 s only three of us in here. Y ou\u2019re perfectly safe.\u201d Garrick turns, his gaze meeting mine even as he continues calling off reps for the other first-year . He nods once, then goes back to his task. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one I worry about,\u201d I say as she leads me to a machinewith a polished wooden seat and two cushioned squares that meet in front of it at knee height. She laughs, and I think it\u2019s the first genuine sound I\u2019ve heard her make. \u201cFair point. Since we can\u2019t work that ankle of yours or your arms until they heal, we\u2019re going to start with the most important muscles you have for staying on a dragon.\u201d She glances down my body and sighs with obvious distaste. \u201cThose weak-ass inner thighs.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re only doing this becau se Xaden is making you, right?\u201d I ask, parking my ass in the seat of the machine with the cushioned wood between my knees as she makes adjustments. Her eyes meet mine and narrow .",
  "\u201cRule number one. He\u2019s Riorson to you, first-year , and you never get to question me about him. Ever .\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s two rules.\u201d I\u2019m starting to think my first guess about them is right. W ith that kind of fierce loyalty , they have to be lovers. I am not jealous. Nope. That pit of ugliness spreading inside my chest isn\u2019t jealousy . It can\u2019 t be. She scoffs and pulls a lever that puts immediate tension on the wood, and they rush outward, separating my thighs. \u201cNow get to work. Push them back together .",

Mage lights illuminate my way down the tunnels as I take a path so familiar that I could walk it with my eyes shut. The scent of earth and stone fills my lungs the deeper I descend, and the stab of longing that\u2019s hit me nearly every day for the past month since I was assigned to Archives duty isn\u2019t quite as sharp as it was yesterday , and that wasn\u2019 t as sharp as the day before. I nod to the first-year scribe at the entrance to the Archives and he jumps out of his seat, hurrying to open the vault-like door . \u201cGood morning, Cadet Sorrengail,\u201d he says, holding the entrance open so I can pass. \u201cI missed you yesterday .\u201d \u201cGood morning , Cadet Pierson.\u201d I offer him a smile as I push the cart through. As quadrant chores go, I\u2019ve scored my favorite.",
  "\u201cI wasn\u2019 t feeling well.\u201d I\u2019d had dizzy spells all day, no doubt from not drink ing enough water , but at least I\u2019d been able to rest. The Archives smell like parchment, book-binding glue, and ink. They smell like home. Rows of twenty-foot-high shelves run the length of the cavernous structure, and I soak in the sight as I wait by the table nearest the entrance,the place where I spent the majo rity of my hours these past five years. Only scribes may pass any farther , and I am a rider . The thought brings a smile to my lips as a woman approaches in a cream tunic and hood, a single rectang le of gold woven onto her shoulder . A first- year. When she pulls the fabric from her head, baring long brown hair, and brings her gaze to meet mine, I full-on grin. I sign, \u201cJesinia!\u201d \u201cCadet Sorreng ail,\u201d she signs back. Her bright eyes sparkle, but she smothers her smile. For just this second, I abhor the rituals and customs of the scribes.",
  "There would be nothin g wrong with pulling my friend into a hug, but she\u2019d be chastised for a loss of composure. After all, how could we know how earnest the scribes are about their work, how dedicated they remain, if they were to crack a smile? \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you,\u201d I sign and can\u2019t quit grinning. \u201cI knew you\u2019d pass the test.\u201d \u201cOnly because I studied with you for the past year,\u201d she signs back, pressing her lips together so they don\u2019 t curve upward. Then her face falls.",
  "\u201cI was horrified to hear about you being forced into the Riders Quadrant. Are you all right?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assure her, then pause to search my memory for the correct sign for a dragon bond. \u201cI\u2019m bonded and\u2026\u201d My feelings are complicated, but I think about the way it felt to soar on Tairn\u2019s back, the gentle nudges from Andarna to keep going when I thought my muscles might give out during Imogen\u2019 s training sessions, and my relationships with my friends, and I can\u2019 t deny the truth. \u201cI\u2019m happy .\u201d Her eyes widen. \u201cAren\u2019 t you constantly worried you\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d She glances left and right, but there\u2019s no one near enough to see us. \u201cYou know\u2026die?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d I nod. \u201cBut oddly enough, you kind of get used to that.\u201d \u201cIf you say so.\u201d She looks skeptical. \u201cLet\u2019 s get you taken care of.",
  "Arethese all returns ? \u201d I nod and reach into the pocket of my pants for a small scroll of parchment and hand it to her before signing , \u201c And a few requests from Professor Devera. \u201d The rider in charge of our small library sends a list of requests and the returns every night , and I fetch them before breakfast , which is probably why my stomach is growling .",
  "Burning all the extra calories from a combination of flight, Rhiannon\u2019 s sparring lessons, and Imogen\u2019 s torture sessions means I have an all-new capacity for food. \u201cAnything else? \u201d she asks after putting the scroll in a hidden pocket in her robes. Maybe it\u2019s being in the Archi ves, but a stab of homesickness nearly bowls me over. \u201cAny chance you guys have a copy of The Fables of the Barren?\u201d Mira was right, I had no business bringing the book of fables with me, but it would be nice to spend an evening curled up with a familiar story . Jesinia\u2019 s brow furrows. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with that text.\u201d I blink. \u201cIt\u2019s not for academics or anything, just a collection of folklore my dad shared with me. A little on the dark side, honestly , but I love it.\u201d I think for a mom ent. There\u2019 s no sign for wyvern or venin, so I spell them out. \u201cWyvern, venin, magic, the battles of good and evil\u2014yo u know , the good stuf f.\u201d I grin. If anyone understands my love of books, it\u2019 s Jesinia. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that one, but I\u2019ll look for it while I pull these.\u201d \u201cThank you.",
  "I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d Now that I\u2019m going to be the one wielding magic, I could use a few good folktales of what happens when humans defile the power channe led to them. No doubt they were written as a parable to warn us of the dangers of bonding dragons, but in Navarre\u2019 s six-hundred-year history of unification, I\u2019ve never read of a single rider losing their soul to their powers. The dragons keep us from that. Jesinia nods and pushes the cart, disappearing into the shelves.",
  "It usually takes about fifteen minutes to gather the requests that come infrom both profe ssors and cadets in my quadrant, but I\u2019m more than content to wait. Scribes come and go, some in groups as they train to become our kingdom\u2019 s histo rians, and I find myself staring at every hooded figure, searching for a face I know I can\u2019 t find\u2014searching for my father . \u201cViolet?\u201d I turn to the left and see Professor Markham leading a squad of first-year scribes. \u201cHello, Professor .\u201d Keeping my face emotionless around him is easier because I know he\u2019ll expect it. \u201cI didn\u2019 t realize you had library chore duty.\u201d He glances toward the spot in the shelves where Jesinia disappeared. \u201cAre you being helped?\u201d \u201cJesinia\u2014\u201d I cringe. \u201cI mean, Cadet Neilwart is most helpful.\u201d \u201cYou know ,\u201d he says to the squad of five as they arc around me, \u201cCadet Sorrengail here was my prized student until the Riders Quadrant stole her away .\u201d His gaze meets mine under his hood. \u201cI had hopes she would return, but alas, she has bonded to not one but two dragons.\u201d A girl to his right gasps, then covers her mouth and mutters an apology . \u201cDon\u2019 t worry , I felt the same way ,\u201d I tell her .",
  "\u201cPerhaps you can explain something to Cadet Nasya over here, who was just griping that there\u2019 s not nearly enough fresh air in here. \u201d Professor Markham turns his focus to a boy on his left. \u201cThis group is just starting their rotation in the Archives.\u201d Nasya turns beet red under his cream hood. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the fire mitigation system,\u201d I tell him. \u201cLess air, less risk of our history burning to the ground.\u201d \u201cAnd the stuf fy hoods?\u201d Nasya lifts a brow at me. \u201cMakes it harder for you to stand out against the tomes,\u201d I explain. \u201cA symbol that no one and nothing is more important than the documents and books in this very room.\u201d My gaze darts around the chamber , and a new pang of homesickness hits me. \u201cExactly .\u201d Professor Markham levels a glare at Nasya. \u201cNow , if you\u2019llexcuse us, Cade t Sorrengail, we have work to attend. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow in Battle Brief.\u201d \u201cYes, sir .\u201d I step back, giving the squad room to pass. \u201cYou ar e sad?\u201d Andarna asks, her voice soft. \u201cJust visiting the Ar chives. No need to worry ,\u201d I tell her .",
  "\u201cIt\u2019s har d to love a second home as much as the first.\u201d I swallow . \u201cIt\u2019s easy when the second home is the right one.\u201d And that is what the Riders Quadrant has become to me\u2014the right home. The longing for the kind of peace and solitude I found only here can\u2019t match the adrenaline rush of flight. Jesinia reappears with the cart, laden down with the requested books and bits of mail for the professors of my quadrant. She signs, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry , but I couldn\u2019 t find that book. I even searched the catalog for wyve rn\u2014I think that\u2019s what you said\u2014but there\u2019 s nothing.\u201d I stare for a second. Our Archives have either a copy or the original of almost every book in Navarre. Only ultrarare or forbidden tomes are excluded. When did folklore become either of those? Though, come to think of it, I never came across anything like The Fables of the Barren on the shelves while I was study ing to become a scribe.",
  "Chimera? Yes. Kraken? Sure. But wyvern or the venin that create them? None. Bizarre. \u201cThat\u2019 s all right. Thank you for looking,\u201d I sign back. \u201cYou look dif ferent,\u201d she signs, then hands the cart over . My eyes widen. \u201cNot bad different, just\u2026dif ferent. Your face is leaner , and even your posture\u2026\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been training.\u201d I pause, my hands hanging by my sides while I consider my answer . \u201cIt\u2019s hard, but great, too. I\u2019m getting quicker on the mat.\u201d \u201cThe mat?\u201d Her brow furrows. \u201cFor sparring.\u201d\u201cRight. I forget that you guys fight each other , too.\u201d Sympathy fills her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m really all right,\u201d I promise her, leaving out the times I\u2019ve caught Oren gripping a dagger in my presence or the way Jack seethes in my direction. \u201cHow about you?",
  "Is it everything you wanted?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s everything and more. So much more. The responsibility we have not only to record history but to speed information from the front lines is more than I ever could have imagined , and it\u2019s so fulfilling.\u201d She presses her lips together again. \u201cGood. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d And I mean it. \u201cBut I worry for you.\u201d She sucks in a breath. \u201cThe uptick in attacks along the border\u2026\u201d Concern etches lines into her forehead. \u201cI know . We hear about them in Battle Brief.\u201d It\u2019s always the same, striking at faltering wards, ransacking villages high in the mountains, and more dead riders. My heart breaks every time we get a report, and a part of me shuts down with each attack that I have to analyze. \u201cAnd Dain?\u201d she asks as we head for the door . \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d My smile falters. \u201cThat\u2019 s a story for another day .\u201d She sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll try and be here around this time so I can see you.\u201d \u201cSounds wonderful.\u201d I refrain from pulling her into a hug and walk through the door she opens.",
  "By the time I return the cart to the library and make it through the lunch line, our time is almost up, which means I\u2019m busy shoveling food in my mouth as fast as I can while the members of our original squad chat around me.",
  "The newbies, two first-years and two second-years we took on when the third squad was dissolved, are a table away . They\u2019ve refuse d to sit with anyone with a rebellion relic. So, fuck them. \u201cIt was the coolest thing ever,\u201d Ridoc contin ues. \u201cOne second he was sparring against that third-year with the wicked broadsword skills, and thenSawyer\u2014\u201d \u201cYou could let him tell the story ,\u201d Rhiannon chides, rolling her eyes. \u201cNo thank you,\u201d Sawyer counters, shaking his head, staring at his fork with a hefty dose of fear . Ridoc grins, in all his glory telling the story . \u201cAnd then the sword just twists in Sawyer \u2019s hand, curving toward the third-year even though Sawyer was way off the mark.\u201d He grimaces in Sawyer \u2019s direction. \u201cSorry , man, but you were.

  "Sawyer nods. \u201cThat\u2019 s what Carr says. Aetos dragged me straight to the professor when he saw it happen.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so jealous!\u201d Ridoc grabs his chest. \u201cI want my signet power to manifest!\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019 t be so excited if it meant you weren\u2019 t sure if your fork would stab into the roof of your mouth because you can\u2019t control it yet.\u201d Sawyer shoves his tray away . \u201cGood point.\u201d Ridoc looks at his own tray . \u201cYou\u2019ll manifes t when your dragon is ready to trust you with all that power ,\u201d Quinn says, then finish es off her water . \u201cJust hope your dragons trust you before about six months and\u2014\u201d She makes a sound like an explosion and mimics it with her hands. \u201cStop scaring the children,\u201d Imogen says. \u201cThat hasn\u2019 t happened in\u201d\u2014 she pauses to think\u2014\u201cdecades.\u201d When we all stare at her, she rolls her eyes. \u201cLook, the relic your dragons transferred onto you at Thres hing is the conduit to let all that magic into your body . If you don\u2019t manifest a signet and let it out, then after a bunch of months, bad things happen.\u201dWe all gawk. \u201cThe magic consumes you,\u201d Quinn adds, making the explosion sound again.",
  "\u201cRelax, it\u2019s not like a hard dead line or something. It\u2019s just an average.\u201d Imogen shrugs. \u201cFuck me, it\u2019 s always something around here,\u201d Ridoc mutters. \u201cFeeling a little luckier now ,\u201d Sawyer says, staring at his fork. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you some wooden utensils,\u201d I tell Sawyer . \u201cAnd you should probably avoid the armory or sparring with\u2026anything.\u201d Sawyer scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019 s the truth . At least I\u2019ll be safe during flight this afternoon.\u201d Adding flight classes to our schedule has been essential since Threshing. The wings rotate for access to the flight field, and today is one of our lucky days of the week. I feel a tingle in my scalp and know if I turn, I\u2019ll find Xaden watching us. Watching me. But I don\u2019t give him the satisfaction of looking. He hasn\u2019 t said so much as a word to me since Threshing. That doesn\u2019 t mean I\u2019m alone \u2014oh, I\u2019m never alone. There\u2019 s always an upperclassman some where near when I\u2019m walking the halls or headed to the gym at night. And they all have rebellion relics.",
  "\u201cI like it better when we have it in the morning,\u201d Rhiannon says, her face souring. \u201cIt\u2019 s way worse after we\u2019ve eaten breakfast and lunch.\u201d \u201cAgreed,\u201d I manage between mouthfuls. \u201cFinish the turkey ,\u201d Imogen orders. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d She and Quinn clear their trays, taking them back to the window for scullery . \u201cIs she any nicer when she\u2019 s training you?\u201d Rhiannon asks. \u201cNo. But she\u2019s efficient.\u201d I finish the turkey as the room begin s to clear , and we all make our way toward the scullery window . \u201cWhat \u2019s Professor Carr like?\u201d I ask Sawyer , then tuck my tray onto the stack. The wielding professor is one of the only ones I haven\u2019 t met, since I haven\u2019 t manifested asignet. \u201cFucking terrifying,\u201d Sawyer answers. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for the entire year to start wielding lessons so everyone can enjoy his particular brand of instruction.\u201d We head out through commons and the rotunda and into the courtyard, all buttoning up our coats. Novemb er has hit hard with gusty winds and frosted grass in the morning, and the first snow isn\u2019 t far behind.",
  "\u201cI knew it would work!\u201d Jack Barlowe says ahead of us, dragging someone under his arm and thumping her head af fectionately . \u201cIsn\u2019 t that Caroline Ashton?\u201d Rhiannon asks, her mouth hanging open as Caroline heads toward the academic wing with Jack. \u201cYeah.\u201d Ridoc tenses. \u201cShe bonded Gleann this morning.\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t he already bonded?\u201d Rhiannon watches them until they disappear into the wing. \u201cHis rider died on our first fligh t lesson.\u201d I focus on the gate ahead that leads to the flight field. \u201cSo I guess the unbonded still have that shot they\u2019re looking for,\u201d Rhiannon mutters. \u201cYeah.\u201d Sawyer nods, his features tense. \u201cThey do.\u201d \u2026 \u201cYou only fell about a dozen times that trip,\u201d Tairn remarks as we land on the flight field. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s a compliment or not.\u201d I take deep breaths and try to calm my racing heart. \u201cTake it as you wish.\u201d I mentally roll my eyes and scoot out of the seat as he dips his shoulder so I can slide down his foreleg.",
  "The move has become so practiced that I barely even notice that other riders are capable of leaping to the ground or descending the proper way. \u201cBesides, you could make it easier , you know .\u201d\u201cOh, I know .\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not the one putting us into spirals with steep banks while Kaori is teaching plain dives.\u201d My feet hit the ground of the field, and I arch an eyebrow at T airn. \u201cI\u2019m training you for battle. He\u2019 s teaching you parlor tricks.\u201d He blinks a golden eye at me and looks away . \u201cDo you think we can get Andarna to join us next week? Even if it\u2019s just to fly along?\u201d I do all the checks Kaori has taught us, looking for any debris that could have lodged between the long, taloned toes of Tairn\u2019s claws or between the rock-hard scales of his underbelly .",
  "\u201cI\u2019m not foolish enough to not know that I have something stuck in my flesh. And I wouldn\u2019 t ask Anda rna to join us unless she requested it. She can\u2019t keep up the speed, and it would only draw unwanted attention.\u201d \u201cI never get to see her,\u201d I blatantly whine. \u201cI\u2019m always stuck with your grumpy ass.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m always her e,\u201d Andarna answers, but there\u2019 s no flicker of gold. She\u2019s most likely in the V ale as usual, but at least she\u2019 s protected there. \u201cThis grumpy ass just caught you a dozen times, Silver One.\u201d \u201cEventually you could call me Violet, you know .\u201d I take the time to examine every row of his scales . One of the biggest dangers to dragons are the smallest things they can\u2019t remove that penetrate between the scales, causing infection.",
  "\u201cI know ,\u201d he repeats. \u201cAnd I could call you Violence like the wingleader .\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019 t dare.\u201d I narrow my eyes as I move forward, checking where his chest begins to rise. \u201cAnd you know how much that ass annoys me.\u201d \u201cAnnoys you?\u201d Tairn chuckles above me, the sound like a chuffing cat. \u201cIs that what you call it when your heart rate\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t even start with me.\u201dA growl rumbles through Tairn\u2019s chest above me and vibrates my very bones.

But not T airn.",
  "Nope, he\u2019 s still standing behind me like an overprotective dad. \u201cI\u2019m not going to harm you!\u201d Dain snaps. \u201cWord for wor d, Silver One.\u201d I blow a breath out slowly . \u201cSorry , he actually said, if you harm me, he\u2019ll scorch the ground where you stand.\u201d I turn and look over my shoulder . \u201cBetter?\u201d Tairn blinks. Dain keeps his eyes on me, but I see it there, the swirling anger Tairn warned me about. \u201cI would rather die than harm you, and you know it.\u201d \u201cHappy now?\u201d I ask T airn. \u201cI\u2019m hungry . I think I\u2019ll partake in a flock of sheep.\u201d He launches with great beats of his wings.\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d Dain\u2019 s voice drops, and he narrows his eyes. \u201cFine. Walk me back.\u201d I motion at Rhiannon to go on without me, and she walks ahead with the others, leaving Dain and me to bring up the rear . We fall back at the edge of the field.",
  "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you can\u2019t keep your fucking seat?\u201d he shouts at me, grabbing my elbow . \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I yank my arm out of his hold. Tairn growls in my mind. \u201cI\u2019ve got this,\u201d I shout back at him. \u201cAll this time, I\u2019ve been letting Kaori teach you, thinking he must have everything unde r control.

I\u2019m sorry if you haven\u2019 t been keeping tabs on your squad, but trust me, Dain.",
  "Everyone knows. And I\u2019m not going to stand here while you lecture me like I\u2019m a child.\u201d I stalk off, my strides eating up the ground as I follow my wing. \u201cYou didn\u2019 t tell me,\u201d he says, anger in his voice giving way to hurt as he catches up, more than matching my pace. \u201cThere\u2019 s not a problem.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cTairn can keep me buckled in magically if he needs to. I\u2019m the one asking him to loosen the restraints. And I\u2019d think twice before you question him. He\u2019s more of the char-first- ask-questions-later type.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem, because he can\u2019 t channel\u2014\u201d \u201cHis full powers?\u201d I ask as we make it out of the field, heading toward the steps that descend next to the Gauntlet. \u201cI know that. Why do you think I\u2019m up there asking him to loosen up?\u201d Frustration is a living , breathing thing inside me, eating up all rational thought.\u201cYou\u2019ve been flying for a month, and you\u2019re still falling.\u201d His voice follows me down the staircase. \u201cSo is half the wing, Dain!\u201d \u201cNot a dozen times, they aren\u2019 t,\u201d he shoots back. He\u2019s on my heels as I pick up my pace toward the path that will lead back to the citadel, the gravel crunching beneath my boots.",
  "\u201cI just want to help you, Vi. How can I help?\u201d I sigh at the plaintive tone in his voice. I keep forgetting this is my best friend, and he\u2019s having to watch me risk my life every day. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d feel if our roles were reversed. Probably just as concerned. So I try to lighten the mood and say, \u201cYou should have seen me a mont h ago when it was three dozen times.\u201d \u201cThree dozen ?\u201d His voice rises on the last word. I halt at the mouth of the tunnel and of fer a smile.",

At least let me help you.\u201d \u201cYou want a list of my flaws?\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cMy thighs are too weak, but I\u2019m building muscle. My hands can\u2019t grip the pommel, but they\u2019re getting stronger . It took weeks for my biceps to heal, so I\u2019m training that one, too. But you don\u2019t have to worry about me, Dain\u2014Imogen is training me.\u201d \u201cBecause Riorso n asked her to,\u201d he guesses, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cProbably .

Say it.\u201d My hands curl into fists, my nails biting into my palms. \u201cI\u2019m terrified you\u2019re not going to make it to graduation, Vi.\u201d His shoulders slump . \u201cYou know exactly how I feel about you, whether or not I can do anything about it, and I\u2019m terrified .\u201d It\u2019s that last line that does me in. Laughter bubbles up through my throat and escapes. His eyes widen.",
  "\u201cThis place cuts away the bullshit and the niceties, revealing whoever you are at your core.\u201d I repeat his words from this summer . \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you said to me?

Someone so focused on the least I\u2019m capable of doing, he can\u2019 t believe I can do so much more?\u201d The warmth drains from his brown eyes. \u201cLet\u2019 s get one thing straight, Dain.\u201d I take a step closer , but the distance between us only widens. \u201cThe reason we\u2019ll never be anything more than friends isn\u2019t because of your rules. It\u2019s because you have no faith in me. Even now, when I\u2019ve survived against all odds and bonded not just one dragon but two, you still think I won\u2019 t make it. So forgive me, but you\u2019re about to be some of the bullshit that this place cuts away from me.\u201d I move to the side and march past him through the tunnel, forcing air through mylungs.

  "Sunlight overpowers me for a second as I walk into the courtyard. Classes are out for the afternoon, and I see Xaden and Garrick leaned up against the wall of the academic building like gods surveying their domain. Xaden arches a dark eyebrow as I pass by .",
  "I flip him the middle finger . I\u2019m not taking his shit today , either . \u201cEverything all right?\u201d Rhiannon asks as I catch up to her and the guys. \u201cDain is an ass\u2014\u201d \u201cMake it stop!\u201d someone screams, rushing down the steps of the rotunda and holding his head. It\u2019s a first-year in Third Wing who sits two rows beneath me in Battle Brief and perpetually drops his quill. \u201cFor gods\u2019 sake, make it stop!\u201d he shrieks, stumbling into the courtyard. My hands hover over my blades. A shadow moves to my left, and a glance tells me Xaden has moved, casually putting himself just ahead of me. The crow d hollows, forming a circle around the first-year as he screams, clutching his head. \u201cJeremiah!\u201d someone shouts, coming forward. \u201cYou!\u201d Jeremiah spins, pointing his finger at the third-year . \u201cYou think I\u2019ve lost it!\u201d His head tilts, and his eyes flare. \u201cHow does he know? He shouldn\u2019 t know!\u201d His tone shifts, like the words aren\u2019 t his own. Chills race down my spine, dragging my stomach to the ground. \u201cAnd you!\u201d He spins again, pointing at a second-year in First Wing. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with him?

Forget the embarrassment. Who cares if people know Dain is thinking about me? Jeremiah\u2019 s signet power is manifesting. He can read minds\u2014an inntinnsic. His power is a death sentence. Ridoc stumbles backward on my left\u2014shoved aside\u2014and I don\u2019t need to look to know whose muscled arm now brushes my shoulder . The scent of mint somehow steadies my heartbeat.

  "The thoughts won\u2019 t stop!\u201d His panic is palpable, clogging my own throat. \u201cDo something,\u201d I beg Xaden, glancing up at him. His unwavering, lethal focus is on Jeremiah, but his body tenses at my plea, poised, ready to strike. \u201cStart mentally reciting whatever bookish shit you\u2019ve learned.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I hiss up at him. \u201cIf you value your secrets, clear your thoughts. Now,\u201d Xaden orders. Oh. Shit. Nothing comes to mind, and we\u2019re clearly in imminent danger . Um\u2026 Many Navarrian defense posts exist beyond the safety of our wards.

The professor grips Jeremiah\u2019 s head with both hands, and a crack echoes off the walls of the silent courtyard. Xaden\u2019 s shadows melt away and Jeremiah falls to the ground, his head at an unnatural, macabre angle. His neck is broken. The professor bends down and lifts Jeremiah\u2019 s body with surprising strength, carrying him into the rotunda.

Adrenaline camouflages the pain as the sword rebounds, unable to split the dragon scales. My knees slam into the hardwood floor , and I thrust my hands beneath my pillow, draw ing back two daggers as I untangle from the covers and gain my feet. How the hell did they get my door unlocked? Blowing my unbound hair out of my face, I meet the wide, shocked eyes of an unbonded first-year , and he\u2019s not the only one. There are seven cadets in my room. Four are unbonded men.

It lands in her shoulder , my favorite target, and she goes down with a cry , clutching her wound. The rest of my weapons are stored near the door .",

There are too many of them. And they all rush at the same damn time. My dagger is kicked out of my hand with appalling ease, and my heart seizes as Oren grips my throat, yanking me toward him. I sweep out for his knees, but my bare feet make no impact as he lifts me off the ground, cutting of f my air supply as I kick for purchase. No. No. No.",

Air rushes into my lungs as cold metal caresses my throat, the oxygen flooding my blood and clearing my head enough to realize this is it. I am going to die. From one heartb eat to what will probably be my last, an overwhelming sorrow seizes my chest, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if I would have made it. Would I have been strong enough to graduate? Would I have become worthy of Tairn and Andarna? Would I have finally made my mother proud? The knife tip touches my skin. My bedroom door flies open, the wood splintering as it slams against the stone wall, but I don\u2019t have a chance to turn to see who is standing there before a shriek pierces my vision. \u201cMine!\u201d Andarna screams. Skin-prickling energy zings down my spine, then rushes to my fingertips and toes, and the next breath I take is in total, complete silence.",
  "\u201cGo!\u201d Andarna demands. I blink and realize the first-year in front of me doesn\u2019 t. She isn\u2019tbreathing. Isn\u2019 t moving. No one is. Everyone in this room is frozen in place\u2026except me.In response to the Gr eat W ar, dragons claimed the western lands and gryphons the central ones, abandoning the Barr ens and the memory of General Daramor , who nearly destr oyed the Continent with his army . Our allies sailed home and we began a period of peace and pr osperity as the pr ovinces of Navarr e united for the first time behind the safety of our wards, under the pr otection of the first bonded riders. \u2014N AVARRE , AN UNEDITED HISTORY BY COLONEL LEWIS MARKHAM CHAPTER NINETEEN What. The. Hell. It\u2019s as if everyone in my room has turned to stone, but I know that can\u2019t be true. Oren\u2019 s body is warm behind me, his skin malleable under my fingers as I shift my grip and shove his bloody forearm, forcing the blade away from my neck. A single drop of blood drips from the sharp tip, splattering on the hardwood, and there\u2019 s a trickle of wetness down my throat. \u201cQuick! I can\u2019 t hold it!\u201d Andarna ur ges, her voice thready .",
  "She\u2019s doing this? I gulp heavin g breaths through my battered windpipe and duck under Oren\u2019 s forearm, freeing myself, then sidestep quickly in the silence. Complete, unearthly silence. The clock on my desk isn\u2019t ticking as I squeeze between Oren\u2019s elbow and a giant guy who used to be from Second Wing. No one breathes. Their gazes are frozen. To the left, the woman I sliced open is hunched over,clutching her forearm, and the man I stabbed is leaned against the wall on the right, staring in horror at his thigh. I mark time in thunderous heartbeats as I stumble into the only open space in my room, but my path to the now-open door isn\u2019 t clear . Xaden fills the doorway like some kind of dark, avenging angel, the messenger of the queen of the gods. He\u2019s fully dressed, his face a mask of veritable rage as shadows curl from the walls on either side of him, hanging in midair .",
  "For the first time since crossing the parapet, I\u2019m so fucking relieved to see him that I could cry . Andarna gasps in my mind\u2014and chaos resumes. Nausea clenches my stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s about damned time,\u201d Tairn rumbles. Xaden\u2019 s gaze snaps to mine, his onyx eyes flaring in shock for no longer than a millisecond before he strides forward, his shadows streaming before him as he stands at my side. He snaps his fingers and the room illuminates, mage lights hovering above us. \u201cYou\u2019re all fucking dead .\u201d His voice is eerily calm and all the scarier for it. Every head in the room turns. \u201cRiorson!\u201d Oren\u2019 s dagger clatters to the floor . \u201cYou think surrendering will save you?\u201d Xaden\u2019 s lethally soft tone sends goose bumps up my arms. \u201cIt is against our code to attack another rider in their sleep.\u201d \u201cBut you know he never should have bonded her!\u201d Oren puts his hands up, his palms facing us.",
  "\u201cYou of all people have reason enough to want the weakling dead. W e\u2019re just correcting a mistake.\u201d \u201cDragons don\u2019t make mistakes.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s shadows grab every assailant but Oren by the throat, then constrict. They struggle, but it doesn\u2019t matter . Their faces turn purple, the shadows holding tight as they sag to their knees,falling in an arc in front of me like lifeless puppets. I can\u2019 t find it in my heart to pity them. Xaden prowls forward as though he has all the time in the world and holds out his palm as yet another tendril of darkness lifts my discarded dagger from the floor . \u201cLet me explain.\u201d Oren eyes the dagger , and his hands tremble. \u201cI\u2019ve heard everything I need to hear.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s fingers curl around the hilt. \u201cShe should have killed you in the field, but she\u2019s merciful.",
  "That\u2019 s not a flaw I posses s.\u201d He slashes forward so quickly that I barely catch the move, and Oren\u2019 s throat opens in a horizontal line, blood streaming down his neck and chest in a torrent. He grabs for his throat, but it\u2019s useless. He bleeds out in seconds, crumpling to the floor . A crimson puddle grows around him. \u201cDamn, Xaden.\u201d Garrick walks in, sheathing his sword as his gaze rakes over the room. \u201cNo time for questioning?\u201d His glance sweeps to me as if cataloging injuries, catching on my throat. \u201cNo need for it,\u201d Xaden counters as Bodhi enters, doing the same quick assessment Garrick had. The similarity between the cousins still gives me pause. Bodhi has the same bronzed skin and strong brow line, but his features aren\u2019 t as angular as Xaden\u2019 s, and his eyes are a lighter shade of brown. He looks like a softer , more approachable version of his older cousin, but my body doesn\u2019 t heat at the sight of him the way it does around Xaden. Or maybe Oren just strangled the common sense out of me. An illogical laugh bubbles up through my lips, and all three men look at me like I\u2019ve hit my head. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d Bodhi says, rubbing the back of his neck.",
  "\u201cWe\u2019re on cleanup?\u201d \u201cCall in help if you need it,\u201d Xaden answers with a nod. Bodies. I\u2019m alive. I\u2019m alive. I\u2019m alive. I repeat the mantra in my head as Xadenwipes the blood from my dagger on the back of Oren\u2019 s tunic. \u201cYes. You\u2019re alive.\u201d Xaden steps over Oren\u2019 s body and two others, retrieving my dagger from the fallen woman\u2019 s shoulder before reaching my armoire. I don\u2019 t even recognize her , and yet she tried to kill me. Garrick and Bodhi haul out the first bodies. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d said that out loud.\u201d The trembling starts in my knees, and then nausea overpowers me. Fuck, I thought I\u2019d worked past this kind of reaction to adrenaline, but here I am, shaking like a leaf as Xaden sorts through my armoire like he hasn\u2019 t just taken out half a dozen people. As if this kind of slaughter is commonplace. \u201cIt\u2019s the shock,\u201d he says, whipping my cloak from its hook and retrieving a pair of boots. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d His words are clipped and break whatever temporary block I had on the pain. It comes flooding back in a throbbing wave that centers in my back.",
  "So much for the adrenaline rush. Every breath feels like I\u2019m shoving my lungs against broken glass, so I keep them short and shallow . But I manage to stay on my feet, retreating until I feel the stone wall against my uninjured side, letting it take my weight. \u201cCome on, Violence.\u201d His cajoling words are at odds with his terse tone as he folds my cloak over his arm and brings my boots through the remaining bodies he\u2019s left on my floor . \u201cPull your shit together and tell me where you\u2019re hurt.\u201d He\u2019s killed six people without so much as a spot of blood on his midnight-black leathers. My boots hit the ground next to my feet and my cloak lands on the little armchair in the corner . I can barely breathe, but can I risk admitting my current weakness to him? His fingers are warm under my chin as he tilts my head up so our gazes collide. Wait\u2026is that a hint of panic swirling in his? \u201cYou\u2019re breathing like crap, so I\u2019m guessing it has to do with\u2014\u201d \u201cMy ribs,\u201d I finish before he can guess. Trying to mask the pain isn\u2019tgoing to work with him.",
  "\u201cThe one by the bed hit the side of my ribs with the sword, but I think they\u2019re just bruised.\u201d There hadn\u2019 t been that telltale snap that comes with broken bones. \u201cMust have been a dull sword.\u201d He cocks a dark eyebrow . \u201cUnless it has something to do with why you sleep in your leather vest.\u201d \u201cTrust him,\u201d Tairn demands. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy .\u201d \u201cIt has to be for now .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s dragon-scal e.\u201d I lift my right arm and pivot slightly so he can see the gaping hole in my nightdress. \u201cMira made it for me.",
  "It\u2019s why I\u2019ve lived this long.\u201d He glances between our bodies, his mouth tensing before he nods once. \u201cIngenious, though I\u2019d say there are multiple reasons for why you\u2019ve made it this far.\u201d Before I can argue that point, his gaze shifts to my throat and narrows at what I imagine has to be the purple imprint of a hand. \u201cI should have killed him slower .\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I\u2019m not. His focus snaps back to my eyes. \u201cNever lie to me.\u201d He says it with such ferocity , bit out through gritted teeth, that I can\u2019 t help but nod in promise. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d I admit. \u201cLet me see.\u201d I open and shut my mouth twice. \u201cIs that a request or a demand?\u201d \u201cYour pick as long as I get to see if that fucker broke your ribs.\u201d His hands curl into fists. Two other men walk in through the open door, Garrick and Bodhi following closely after. They\u2019re all\u2026dressed. Fully clothed at\u2014I glance at the clock\u2014two a.m. \u201cTake those two, and we\u2019ll get the last ones,\u201d Garrick orders , and the others get to work, carrying the last of the bodies out through the door. I can\u2019t help but notice they all have rebellion relics shimmeri ng up theirarms, but I keep the observation to myself.",
  "\u201cThank you,\u201d Xaden says, then flicks his hand and my door shuts with a soft click . \u201cNow , let me see your ribs. W e\u2019re wasting time.\u201d I swallow , then nod. Better to know now if they\u2019re broken anyw ay. I turn my back on him, but I can see his face in the full-length mirror as I shrug out of the billowing sleeves of my nightdress, holding the material above my breasts as it dips in the back to my waist. \u201cY ou\u2019ll have to\u2014\u201d \u201cI know how to handle a corset.\u201d His jaw flexes once, and some thing that reminds me of raw hunger flitters across his expression before he locks it down, drawing my hair over my shoulder with surprising gentleness. His fingers skim my bare skin and I suppress a shiver , locking my muscles so I don\u2019 t arch into his touch. What the hell is wrong with me?",
  "There\u2019 s still blood on my floor and yet my breaths are tight for the entirely wrong reason as he makes quick work of the laces, starting at the bottom. He wasn\u2019 t lying. He absolu tely knows his way around a corset. \u201cHow the hell do you get yourself into this thing every morn ing?\u201d he asks, clearing his throat as inch after inch of my back is exposed. \u201cI\u2019m freakishly flexible. It\u2019s part of the whole bones-snapping, joints- tearing thing,\u201d I answer over my shoulder . Our eyes meet, and warmth flutters through my stomach. The moment is gone as quickly as it came, and he pulls my armor apart, inspecting my right side. Gentle fingers stroke over the abused ribs, then prod carefully . \u201cYou have one hell of a bruise, but I don\u2019 t think they\u2019re broken.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s what I thought. Thank you for checking.\u201d It should be awkward, but somehow it isn\u2019 t, even as he laces me back up, securing the ends. \u201cYou\u2019ll live. T urn around.\u201d I do, tugging my nightdress back over my shoulders, and he drops to his knees on the floor before me. My eyes widen. Xaden Riorson is kneeling before me, his black hair atthe perfect level for me to run my fingers through the thickness.",
  "It\u2019s probably the only thing that\u2019s soft about him.",
  "How many women have felt those strands between their fingers? Why the hell do I care? \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to walk through the pain, and we have to do it fast.\u201d He grabs a boot, then taps my foot. \u201cCan you lift it up?\u201d I nod, lifting my foot. Then he robs me of every logical thought by putting on my boots and lacing them one at a time. This is the same man who had no problems with my death just a few months ago, and my brain can\u2019t seem to wrap itself around the different sides of him. \u201cLet\u2019 s go.\u201d He wraps my cloak around my shoulders and buttons it at my collar like I\u2019m something precio us. Now I know I\u2019m in shock because I\u2019m anything but precious to Xaden Riorson. His gaze drifts over my hair and he blink s once before tugging my hood up over the fading dark-to-light mass. Then he grasps my hand and tugs me into the hallway . His fingers are strong as they curl around mine, his grip firm but not too tight. Every other door is shut. The attack wasn\u2019 t even loud enough to rouse my neighbors. I\u2019d be dead by now if Xaden hadn\u2019 t shown up, even if I had managed to get out of Oren\u2019 s hold. But how did that happen?",
  "\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d The hallways are dimly lit by blue mage lights, the kind that signal it\u2019 s still night for those without windows. \u201c Keep talking loud enough for others to hear , and someone will stop us before we get anywhere. \u201d \u201c Can \u2019 t you just hide us in shadows or something ? \u201d \u201c Sure , because a giant black cloud moving down the hallway isn \u2019 t going to look more suspicious than a couple sneaking around. \u201d He shoots me a look that keeps me from countering . Point taken. Not that we\u2019re a couple.Not that I would n\u2019t climb the man like a tree if presented with the right set of circumstances. I cringe as we make it to the main hallway of the dormitory .",
  "There will never , ever be a right set of circumstances when it comes to him, let alone right after he\u2019 s executed half a dozen people. But in my defense, and in a sick, twisted way, his rescue was pretty damned hot, even if he is hauling me down the hallway at an untenable speed. Even if he only did it because my life is tied to his. My chest screams for a break, but there\u2019 s none to be found as he leads me past the spiral staircase that leads up to the second- and third-year dorms and into the rotunda. It\u2019s going to take weeks for my ribs to fully heal. Our boots again st the marble floor are the only sounds as we pass into the academic wing. Instead of turnin g left, toward the sparring gym, he takes us right, down a set of stairs that I know leads to storage. Halfway down the steps, he pauses, and I nearly run into the sword strapped to his back. Then he gestures with his right hand, keeping mine in his left. Click. Xaden pushes on the stones and a hidden door swings open. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d I whisper at the expansive tunnel revealed before us. \u201cHope you\u2019re not afraid of the dark.\u201d He pulls me inside, and suffocating darkness envelops us as the door closes.",
  "This is fine. This is absolutely fine. \u201cBut just in case you are,\u201d Xaden says, his voice at full volume as he snaps. A mage light hovers above our head, illuminating our surroundings. \u201cThanks.\u201d The tunnel is supported by arches of stone and the floor is smooth, as though it\u2019s been trave led more than its entrance lets on. It smells like earth but isn\u2019 t dank, and it goes on for what seems like an eternity . He drops my hand and starts walking. \u201cKeep up.\u201d \u201cYou could\u2014\u201d I wince. Fuck, my chest hurts. \u201cBe a little more considerate.\u201d I trudge after him, dropping my hood.\u201cI\u2019m not going to baby you like Aetos does,\u201d he says withou t turning around. \u201cThat\u2019 s only going to get you killed once we get out of Basgiath.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019 t baby me.\u201d \u201cHe does and you know it. You hate it, too, if the vibe I\u2019m picking up on is any indication.\u201d He falls back to walk at my side. \u201cOr did I read that wrong?\u201d \u201cHe thinks this place is too dangerous for someone\u2026like me, and after what just happen ed, I\u2019m not sure I can really argue with him.\u201d I was asleep . That\u2019 s the only time we\u2019re supposed to be guaranteed safety around here.",
  "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll bother sleeping again.\u201d I shoot a look sideways at his irritatingly gorgeous profile. \u201cAnd if you even think about suggesting that you sleep with me for safety from now on\u2014\u201d He scoffs. \u201cHardly . I don\u2019t fuck first-years\u2014even when I was one\u2014let alone\u2026you.\u201d \u201cWho said anything about fucking?\u201d I fire back, cursing myself as the ache in my ribs only intensifies . \u201cI\u2019d have to be a masochist to sleep with you, and I can assure you, I\u2019m not.\u201d Fantasizing about it doesn\u2019 t count. \u201cMasochist, huh?\u201d A corner of his mouth quirks into a smirk. \u201cYou hardly give off snuggly morning-after vibes.\u201d A smile of my own curves my lips. \u201cUnless you\u2019re worried about me killing you while we sleep.\u201d W e round a corner , and the tunnel continues. \u201cI have zero concern about that. As violent as you are, and skilled with those daggers, I\u2019m not even sure you could kill a fly. Don\u2019 t think I didn\u2019 t notice that you managed to wound three of them and never went for a kill shot.\u201d He shoots a disapproving look my way . \u201cI\u2019ve never killed anyone,\u201d I whisper like it\u2019 s a secret. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get over that.",
  "All we are after graduation are weapons, and it\u2019 s best if we\u2019re honed before leaving the gates.\u201d \u201cIs that where we\u2019re going? Are we leaving the gates?\u201d I\u2019ve lost all sense of direction in here.\u201cWe\u2019re going to ask Tairn what the hell just happened.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s jaw flexes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about the attack. How the hell did they get past your locks?\u201d I shrug but don\u2019t bother to explain. There\u2019 s no way he\u2019ll believe me. I barely believe it myself. \u201cWe\u2019d better figure it out so it doesn\u2019 t happen again. I refuse to sleep on your fucking floor like some kind of guard dog.\u201d \u201cWait. This is another way to the flight field?\u201d I do my best to mentally wall off the pain in my throat and ribs. \u201cHe\u2019 s bringing me to you,\u201d I tell Tairn. \u201cI know .\u201d \u201cAre you going to tell me what that was in ther e?\u201d \u201cI would if I knew .\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Xaden says, and the path curves again. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly common knowledge.",
  "And I\u2019m going to ask you to tuck this little tunnel into the file of secrets you keep on my behalf.\u201d \u201cLet me guess, and you\u2019ll know if I tell?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Another smirk appears, and I look away before he can catch me staring. \u201cAre you going to promise me another favor?\u201d The path begins to climb, and the ascent is anything but gentle. Every breath reminds me of what happened less than an hour ago. \u201cHaving one of my favors is more than enough, and we\u2019v e already reached mutuall y assured destruction status, Sorrengail.",
  "Now , can you push through it, or do you need me to carry you?\u201d \u201cThat sounds like an insult, not an of fer.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re catching on.\u201d But his pace slows to match mine. The ground shifts beneath my feet as though it\u2019s rocking, but I know better . It\u2019s my head, the result of the pain and stress. My steps wobble. Xaden\u2019 s arm wraps around my waist, steadying me. I hate how his touchelevates my heart rate as we continue the climb, but I don\u2019t protest. I don\u2019t want to be grateful for anything when it comes to him, but man if that minty scent of his isn\u2019 t delicious. \u201cWhat were you doing tonight anyway?\u201d \u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d His tone clearly insinuates that I shouldn\u2019 t. Too bad. \u201cYou made it to my room within minutes, and you\u2019re not exactly dressed for sleeping.\u201d He\u2019 s strapped with a sword for crying out loud. \u201cMaybe I sleep in my armor , too.\u201d \u201cThen you should pick more trustworthy bedmates.\u201d He snorts, a flash of a smile appearing for a heartbeat. A real one. Not the fake, forced sneer I\u2019m used to seeing or the cocky little smirk. An honest, heart-stopping smile that I\u2019m anything but immune to. It\u2019s gone as fast as it appears, though.",
  "\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to tell me?\u201d I ask. I\u2019d be frustrated if I didn\u2019 t hurt so damned much. And I\u2019m not even going to touch why he needed to haul us all the way to T airn when I can chat with him anytime I want. Unless he wants to talk to T airn, which is\u2026ballsy . \u201cNope. Third-year business.\u201d He lets go when we reach the stonewalled end of the tunnel.",
  "A few hand gestures and another click sounds before he pushes open the door . We step out into crisp, freezingly cold November air . \u201cWhat the hell,\u201d I whisper . The door is built into a stack of boulders on the eastern side of the field. \u201cIt\u2019s camouflaged.\u201d Xaden waves a hand and the door closes, blending into the rock as if it\u2019 s a part of it. There\u2019 s a sound I now recognize as the steady beat of wings, and I look up to see the three dragons block out the stars as they descend . The earth shudders as they land in front of us. \u201cI\u2019m guessing the wingleader wants a word?\u201d Tairn steps forward and Sgaeyl follows, her wings tucked in tight, her golden eyes narrowing on me.Andarna scurrie s between Sgaeyl\u2019 s claws, galloping toward us. She skids the last dozen feet, paws digging into the ground to stop just in front of me, bringing her nose to my ribs as an urgent sense of anxiety fills my head, swamping me with feelings I know aren\u2019 t mine. \u201cNo broken bones,\u201d I promise, stroking my hand over the bumpy ridges of her head. \u201cThey\u2019re just bruised.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sur e?\u201d she asks, worry widening her eyes. \u201cAs sure as I can be.\u201d I force a smile.",
  "Trudging out here in the middle of the night is worth it to alleviate her anxiety . \u201cYes, I want a word. What the hell kind of powers are you channeling to her?\u201d Xaden demands, staring up at T airn like he isn\u2019 t\u2026Tairn. Yep. Ballsy . Every muscle in my body locks, sure that Tairn is about to torch Xaden for impudence. \u201cNone of your business what I choose or do not choose to channel towar d my rider ,\u201d Tairn answers with a growl. This is going well. \u201cHe says\u2014\u201d I start. \u201cI heard him,\u201d Xaden counters, not sparing me a glance. \u201cYou what?\u201d My eyebrows hit my hairline, and Andarna retreat s to stand with the others. Dragons only talk to their riders. That\u2019 s what I\u2019ve always been taught. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely my business when you expect me to protect her,\u201d Xaden retorts, his voice rising.",
  "\u201cI got the message to you just fine, human.\u201d Tairn\u2019s head swivels in that snakelike motion that puts me on alert. He\u2019 s more than agitated. \u201cAnd I barely made it.\u201d The words come out clipped through clenched teeth. \u201cShe would have been dead if I\u2019d been thirty seconds later .\u201d \u201cSeems like you had thirty seconds gifted to you.\u201d Tairn\u2019s chest rumbles with a growl. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to know what the fuck happened in there!\u201dI inhale sharply . \u201cDon\u2019 t hurt him,\u201d I beg Tairn. \u201cHe saved me.\u201d I\u2019ve never seen someone so much as dare to speak to another rider \u2019s dragon, yet alone yell at one, especially not one as powerful as T airn. He grumbles in response. \u201cWe need to know what happened in that room.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s dark gaze cuts through me like a knife for a millisecond before he glares back at T airn. \u201cDo not dare to try and read me, human, or you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d Tairn\u2019s mouth opens, his tongue curling in a motion I know all too well. I move between the two and tilt my chin at Tairn. \u201cHe\u2019 s just a little freaked out.",
  "Don\u2019 t scorch him.\u201d \u201cAt least we agree on somethin g.\u201d A femin ine voice sounds through my head. Sgaeyl. In awe, I blink up at the navy-blue daggertail as Xaden moves to my side. \u201cShe talked to me.\u201d \u201cI know. I heard.\u201d He folds his arms across his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re mates. It\u2019 s the same reason I\u2019m chained to you.\u201d \u201cYou make it sound so pleasant.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d He turns to face me. \u201cBut you and I are exactly that, Violence. We\u2019re chained. Tethered. You die, I die, so I damn well deserve to know how the hell you were under Seifert\u2019 s knife one second and across the room in anoth er. Is that the signet power you\u2019ve manifested with Tairn? Come clean.",
  "Now .\u201d His eyes bore into me. \u201cI don\u2019 t know what happened,\u201d I answer honestly . \u201cNatur e likes all things in balance,\u201d Andarna says like she\u2019s reciting facts, just like I do when I\u2019m nervous. \u201cThat\u2019 s the first thing we\u2019r e taught.\u201d I pivot to face the golden dragon, repeating what she said to Xaden. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d he asks me, not her . Guess that means he can hear T airn, but not Andarna.\u201cWell, not the first thing.\u201d Andarn a sits, flicking her feath ertail along the frost-laden grass. \u201cThe first thing is we shouldn\u2019 t bond until we\u2019re full- grown.\u201d She cocks her head to the side. \u201cOr maybe the first is wher e the sheep ar e?",
  "I like goats better , though.\u201d \u201cThis is why feathertails don\u2019t bond.\u201d Tairn sighs with a hefty dose of exasperation. \u201cLet her explain,\u201d Sgaeyl urges, clicking her talons like nails on the ground. \u201cFeathertails shouldn\u2019 t bond because they can accidentally gift their powers to humans,\u201d Andarna continues . \u201cDragons can\u2019t channel\u2014not really\u2014until we\u2019r e big, but we\u2019r e all born with something special.\u201d I relay the message. \u201cLike a signet?\u201d I ask out loud so Xaden can hear . \u201cNo,\u201d Sgaeyl answers . \u201cA signet is a combination of our power with your own ability to channel. It reflects who you are at the core of your being.\u201d Andarna sits up and tilts her head proudly . \u201cBut I gave my gift directly to you. Because I\u2019m still a feathertail.\u201d I repeat again, staring at the smaller dragon. Almost nothing is known about feathertails because they\u2019re never seen outside the Vale. They\u2019re guarded. They\u2019re\u2026 I swallow . Wait. What did she say? \u201cYou\u2019re still a feathertail?\u201d \u201cYep! For another couple of years, pr obably .\u201d She blinks slowly and then cracks a yawn, her forked tail curling. Oh.",
  "Gods. \u201cY ou\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re a hatchling,\u201d I whisper . \u201cI am not!\u201d Andarn a puffs steam into the air. \u201cI\u2019m two! The hatchlings can\u2019t even fly!\u201d \u201cShe\u2019 s a what?\u201d Xaden\u2019 s gaze swings between Andarna and me. I glare up at T airn. \u201cY ou let a juvenile bond? A juvenile train for war?\u201d \u201cWe matur e at a much faster rate than humans,\u201d he argues, having the nerve to look affronted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure anyone lets Andarna doanything .\u201d \u201cHow much faster?\u201d I gasp. \u201cShe\u2019 s two years old!\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll be full-gr own in a year or two, but some are slower than others,\u201d Sgaeyl answers. \u201cAnd if I thought she\u2019d actually bond, I would have objected harder to her Right of Benefaction.\u201d She chuffs at Andarna in obvious disapproval. \u201cHold on. Is Andarna yours ?\u201d Xaden walks a step toward Sgaeyl, and the tone in his voice is one I\u2019ve never heard. He\u2019s\u2026hurt.",
  "\u201cHave you hidden a hatchling away from me these last two years?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t be ridiculous.\u201d Sgaeyl blows out a blast of air that ruffles Xaden\u2019 s hair. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d let my offspring bond while still feather ed?\u201d \u201cHer par ents passed befor e hatching,\u201d Tairn answers. My heart sinks. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry , Andarna.\u201d \u201cI have lots of elders,\u201d she responds, as though that makes up for it, but having lost my dad\u2026I know it doesn\u2019 t. \u201cNot enough to keep you off the Threshing field,\u201d Tairn grumbles. \u201cFeathertails don\u2019t bond because their power is too unpredictable. Unstable.\u201d \u201cUnpredictable?\u201d Xaden questions. \u201cThe same way you wouldn\u2019 t hand a toddler your signet, would you, wingleader?\u201d Tairn grunts when Andarna sags against his foreleg. \u201cGods, no. I could barely control it as a first-year .\u201d Xaden shakes his head. It\u2019s odd to imagine Xaden ever not being in control. Hell, I\u2019d pay good money to see him lose it. To be the one he lost it with.",
  "Nope. I shut that thought down immediately . \u201cExactly . Bonding too young allows them to give their gift directly, and a rider could easily drain them and burn out.\u201d \u201cI would never!\u201d I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019 s why I chose you.\u201d Andarna\u2019 s head flops against Tairn\u2019s leg. Howcould I not see it before now? Her rounded eyes, her paws\u2026 \u201cOf course, you wouldn\u2019 t know . Feathertails aren\u2019t supposed to be seen,\u201d Tairn says, glancing sideways at his mate. She doesn\u2019 t even roll her eyes. \u201cIf leade rship knew riders could take her gifts for themselves, rather than depending on their own signets \u2026\u201d Xaden says, staring at Andarna as she blinks slower and slower . \u201cShe\u2019d be hunted,\u201d I finish quietly . \u201cWhich is why you can\u2019t tell anyone what she is,\u201d Sgaeyl says. \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll matur e once you\u2019r e out of the quadrant, and the elders are already placing mor e\u2026stringent pr otections on the feathertails.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019 t,\u201d I promise. \u201cAndarna , thank you. Whatever you did saved my life.\u201d \u201cI made time stop.\u201d Her mouth drops open into another jaw-cracking yawn. \u201cBut only for a little bit.\u201d Wait.",
  "What? My stomach hits the ground as I stare into Andarna\u2019 s golden eyes and forget the pain, the solid earth beneath my feet, even the need to breathe as shock rolls through me, robbing me of logic. No one can stop time. Nothing can stop it. It\u2019 s\u2026unheard of. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Xaden asks, gripping my shoulders to steady me. Tairn growls and a puf f of steam blasts us both. \u201cI\u2019d take your hands off the rider ,\u201d Sgaeyl warns. Xaden loosens his grip but continues to cradle my shoulders. \u201cTell me what she said. Please.\u201d His mouth tightens and I know that last bit cost him. \u201cShe can pause time,\u201d I force out, stumbling over my words. \u201cBriefly .\u201d Xaden\u2019 s features slacken, and for the first time, he doesn\u2019 t look like the stalwart, lethal wingleader I met on the parapet. He\u2019s flat-out shocked as his gaze swings to Andarna. \u201cY ou can stop time?\u201d \u201cAnd now we can stop it.\u201d She blinks slowly , and I can feel exhaustion wafting off her.",
  "Channeling that gift to me tonight cost her. She can barelykeep her eyes open. \u201cIn small increments,\u201d I whisper . \u201cIn small increments,\u201d Xaden echoes slowly , like he\u2019s absorbing the information. \u201cAnd if I use it too much, I can kill you,\u201d I say softly to Andarna. \u201cKill us.\u201d She stands on all four paws. \u201cBut I know you won\u2019 t.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to be worthy .\u201d The ramifications of this gift, this exceptional power, hit me like a death blow , and my stomach bottoms out. \u201cIs Professor Carr going to kill me, too?\u201d Every gaze whips toward me, and Xaden\u2019 s grip tightens on my shoulders, his thumbs stroking in a soothing motion. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d \u201cHe killed Jeremiah.\u201d I push the panic away and focus on the tiny golden flecks in Xaden\u2019 s onyx eyes. \u201cYou saw him snap his neck like a twig right in front of the whole quadrant.\u201d \u201cJeremiah was an inntinnsic.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s voice lowers. \u201cA mind reader is a capital of fense. Y ou know that.\u201d \u201cAnd what are they going to do if they find out I can stop time?\u201d Terror freezes the blood in my veins. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to find out,\u201d Xaden promises. \u201cNo one is going to tell them.",
  "Not you. Not me. Not them.\u201d He motions with one hand toward our trio of dragons. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019 s right,\u201d Tairn says. \u201cThey can\u2019t find out. And there\u2019s no saying how long you\u2019ll have the ability . Most feathertail gifts disappear with maturity when they begin to channel.\u201d Andarna cracks another yawn, looking nearly dead on her feet. \u201cGet some sleep,\u201d I tell her . \u201cThank you for helping me tonight. \u201d \u201cLet\u2019 s go, Golden One,\u201d Tairn says, and they all bend slightly , then launch, wind gusting against my face. Andarna struggles, her wings beating twice as hard, and Tairn flies up underneath her, taking her weight and continuing on to the V ale.\u201cPromise me you won\u2019 t tell anyone about the time-stopping,\u201d Xaden asks as we head back into the tunnel , but it feels an awful lot like a command. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for your safety .",
  "Rare abilities, when kept secret, are the most valuable form of currency we possess.\u201d My brow furrows as I study the stark lines of the rebellion relic that winds up his neck, marking him as a traitor \u2019s son, warning everyone that he\u2019s not to be trusted. Maybe he\u2019s telling me to keep quiet for his own gain, so he can use me later down the road. At least that means he intends for me to be alive at a later date. \u201cWe need to figure out how unbonded cadets got in your room,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a rider there,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSomeone who ran away before you arrived. She must have unlocked it from the outside.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d He halts, taking my elbow gently and turning me toward him. I shake my head. There\u2019 s no way he\u2019ll believe me. I barely believe it myself.",
  "\u201cAt some point, you and I are going to have to start trusting each other , Sorrengail. The rest of our lives depend on it.\u201d Fury swims in Xaden\u2019 s eyes. \u201cNow tell me who.\u201dAccusing a wingleader of wr ongdoing is the most danger ous of all accusations. If you\u2019r e right, then we\u2019ve failed as a quadrant to select the best wingleaders. If you\u2019r e wrong, you\u2019r e dead. \u2014M Y TIME AS A CADET : A M EMOIR BY GENERAL AUGUSTINE MELGREN CHAPTER TWENTY \u201cOren Seifert.\u201d Captain Fitzgibbons finishes reading the death roll and closes the scroll as we stand in formation the next morning, our breath creating clouds in the chilled air . \u201cWe commend their souls to Malek.\u201d There\u2019 s no room for sorrow in my heart for six of the eight names, not when I\u2019m shiftin g my weight to soothe the ache of black-and-blu e along my ribs and ignoring the way other riders stare at the ring of bruises I wear around my throat. The two others on today\u2019 s list are third-years from Second Wing, killed on a training operation near the Braevick border , according to breakfast gossip, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if that\u2019s where Xaden had been before coming to my rescue last night.",
  "\u201cI can\u2019t believe they tried to kill you while you were sleeping.\u201d Rhiannon\u2019 s still seething at breakfast after I told our table what happened. Maybe Xaden is fighting to keep last night\u2019 s events a secret, to hide what a liabilit y I really am to him, because no one else in leadership knows. He didn\u2019 t say a single word after I told him who unlocked the door, so I have no clue if he believes me or not. \u201cEven worse, I think I\u2019m getting used to it.\u201d Either I have kick-ass compartmentalization skills or I really am acclimating to always being atarget. Captain Fitzgibbons makes some minor announcements, and I tune him out as someone strides our way, cutting through the space between the Flame and T ail Sections of our wing. Just like it always does, my stupid, hormone-driven heart stutters at the first sight of Xaden. Even the most effective poisons come in pretty packages, and Xaden\u2019 s exactly that\u2014as beautiful as he is lethal. He looks deceptively calm as he approaches, but I can feel his tension as if it\u2019s my own, like a panther prowling toward his prey. The wind ruffles his hair, and I sigh at the completely unfair advantage he has over every man in this courtyard. He doesn\u2019 t even have to try to look sexy\u2026he just is.",
  "Oh shit. This feeling right here\u2014the way my breath catches and my entire body draw s tight when he\u2019s near\u2014is why I haven\u2019 t taken anyone to bed or celebrated like the rest of my perfectly normal friends. This feeling is why I haven\u2019 t wanted anyone\u2026else. Because I want him.",
  "There aren\u2019 t enough curse words in the world for this. His gaze locks with mine just long enough to quicken my pulse before he addresses Dain, ignoring Fitzgibbons\u2019 s announcements behind him. \u201cThere\u2019 s a change to your squad roll.\u201d \u201cWingleader?\u201d Dain questions, his spine straightening. \u201cWe just absorbed four from the dissolution of the third squad.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Xaden looks to the right, where Second Squad, Tail Section stands at attention. \u201cBelden, we\u2019re making a roll change.\u201d \u201cYes, sir .\u201d The squad leader nods once. \u201cAetos, Vaughn Penley will be leaving your command, and you\u2019ll be gaining Liam Mairi from T ail Section.\u201d Dain\u2019 s mouth snaps shut, and he nods. We all watch as the two first-year riders exchange places. Penley\u2019s only been with us since Threshing, so there\u2019 s no heartfelt goodby e from ouroriginal squad, but the other three grumble. Liam nods at Xaden, and my stomach twists. I know exactly why he\u2019s being put under Dain\u2019 s comman d. The guy is massive, as tall as Sawyer and as built as Dain, with light-blond hair, prominent nose, blue eyes, and the sprawling rebellion relic that begins at his wrist and disappears under the sleeve of his tunic gives his mission away .",
  "\u201cI do not need a bodyguard,\u201d I snap at Xaden. Am I out of line speaking to a wingleader that way? Absolutely . Do I care? Not one bit. He ignores me, facing Dain. \u201cLiam is statistically the strongest first-year in the quadrant. He has the faste st time up the Gauntlet, hasn\u2019 t lost a single challenge, and is bonded to an exceptionally strong Red Daggertail. Any squad would be lucky to have him, and he\u2019s all yours, Aetos. You can thank me when you win the Squad Battle in the spring.\u201d Liam steps into formation behind me, taking Penley\u2019 s place. \u201cI. Do. Not. Need. A. Bodyguard,\u201d I repeat, a little louder this time. I could give two fucks who hears me. One of the first-years behind me gasps, mortified by my audacity , no doubt. Imogen snorts. \u201cGood luck with that approach.\u201d Xaden walks past Dain and stands directly in front of me, leaning into my space. \u201cYou do, though, as we both learned last night. And I can\u2019t be everywhere you are.",
  "But Liam here\u201d\u2014he points back to the blond Tyr \u2014\u201che\u2019 s a first-year , so he can be in every class, at every challenge , and I even had him assigned to library duty, so I hope you get used to him, Sorrengail.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re overstepping.\u201d My nails bite into my palms. \u201cYou haven\u2019 t begun to see overstepping,\u201d he warns, his voice dropping low, sending a shiver down my spine. \u201cAny threat against you is a threat against me, and as we\u2019ve already established, I have more important things to do than sleep on your floor .\u201dHeat flushes up my neck and stains my cheeks. \u201cHe is not sleeping in my room.\u201d \u201cOf course not.\u201d He freaking smirks , and my traitor ous stomach dips. \u201cI had him moved into the one next to yours. Wouldn\u2019 t want to overstep .\u201d He turns on his heel and walks away , headed back to his place at the front of our formation. \u201cFucking mated dragons,\u201d Dain seethes, keeping his eyes forward. Fitzgibbons finishes his announcements and steps to the back of the dais, which would usually signal the end of formation, but Commandant Panchek takes the podium. He makes it a habit to avoid morning formation, which means something is up.",
  "\u201cWhat\u2019 s going on with Panchek?\u201d Rhiannon asks at my side. \u201cNot sure.\u201d I take a deep breath, wincing at the pain in my ribs. \u201cIt has to be something big if he\u2019s fumbling with a Codex up there,\u201d Rhiannon says. \u201cQuiet,\u201d Dain orders, glancing back over his shoulder at us for the first time this morning. He does a double-take, his eyes flaring wide as he catches sight of my neck. \u201cV i?\u201d He hasn\u2019t spoke n to me since our fight yesterday . Gods, how has it been less than twenty-four hours when I feel like a completely dif ferent person?",
  "\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assure him, but he\u2019s still staring at my throat, locked in shock. \u201cSquad Leader Aetos, people are staring.\u201d We hold way more than our share of the attention as Commandant Panchek begins to speak at the podium, telling us that there\u2019 s another matter to handle this morning, but Dain won\u2019 t look away . \u201cDain!\u201d He blink s, jerkin g his gaze to mine, and the apology in those soft brown eyes clogs my throat. \u201cIs that what Riorson meant by last night ?\u201d I nod. \u201cI didn\u2019 t know . Why didn\u2019 t you tell me?\u201d Because you wouldn\u2019 t believe me, even if I did.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I repeat, nodding toward the dais. \u201cLater .\u201d He turns, but the motion is reluctant. \u201cIt has been brought to my atten tion as your commandant that a breach of the Codex has occurred,\u201d Panchek calls out over the courtyard. \u201cAs you know , breaches of our most sacred laws are not to be tolerated,\u201d Panchek continues. \u201cThis matter will be addressed here and now.",
  "Will the accuser please step forward.\u201d \u201cSomeone\u2019 s in trouble,\u201d Rhiannon whispers. \u201cThink Ridoc finally got caught in T yvon V aren\u2019 s bed?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s hardly against the Codex,\u201d Ridoc murmurs from behind us. \u201cHe\u2019 s the execu tive officer for Second Wing.\u201d I send a pointed look over my shoulder . \u201cAnd?\u201d Ridoc shrugs, grinning without a touch of remorse. \u201cFraternizing with command is frowned upon, not unlawful.\u201d I sigh, facing forward. \u201cI miss sex.\u201d I really do, and it\u2019s not just the physical gratification, either . There\u2019 s a sense of connection in those moments that I crave, a momentary banishment of loneliness. The first is something I\u2019m sure Xaden would be more than capable of providing, if he ever though t of me that way, but the second? He\u2019s the last person I should be craving, but lust and logic never seem to go hand in hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re looki ng for a little fun, I\u2019m happy to oblige\u2014\u201d Ridoc starts, shoving his floppy brown hair of f his forehead with a wink. \u201cI miss good sex,\u201d I counter , smothering a smile as someone walks from the front of formation toward the dais, indistinguishable through the rows of the squads ahead of us.",
  "\u201cBesid es, apparently you\u2019re spoken for.\u201d Have to admit, it feels good to tease a friend about something so trivia l. It\u2019s a tiny slice of normalcy in an otherwise macabre environment. \u201cWe\u2019re not exclusive,\u201d Ridoc counters. \u201cIt\u2019s like Rhiannon and what\u2019 s- her-name\u2026\u201d\u201cTara,\u201d Rhiannon of fers. \u201cWill you all shut the hell up?\u201d Dain barks in his superior -officer voice. Our mouths snap shut. Mine drops open again when I realize it\u2019s Xaden climbing the steps to the dais. My stomach lurches as I suck in a tight breath. \u201cThis is about me,\u201d I whisper . Dain glances back at me, confu sion furrowing his brow before whipping his atten tion toward the dais, where Xaden now stands at the podium, somehow managing to fill the entire stage with his presence. From what I remember reading, his father had that same magnetism, the ability to hold and capture a crowd with nothing but his words\u2026 words that led to Brennan\u2019 s death.",
  "\u201cEarly this morning,\u201d he begins, his deep voice carrying over the formation, \u201ca rider in my wing was brutally , illegally attacked in her sleep with the intent of murder by a group primarily composed of unbondeds.\u201d A collec tion of murmurs and gasps fills the air, and Dain\u2019 s shoulders stiffen. \u201cAs we all know , this is a violation of Article Three, Section Two of the Dragon Rider \u2019s Codex and, in addition to being dishonorable, is a capital offense.\u201d I feel the weight of a dozen glances, but it\u2019 s Xaden\u2019 s I feel most of all.",
  "His hand s clenc h the sides of the podium. \u201cHaving been alerted by my dragon, I interrupted the attack along with two other Fourth Wing riders.\u201d He dips his chin toward our wing, and two riders\u2014Garrick and Bodhi\u2014 break formation, then climb the steps to stand behind Xaden, their hands at their sides. \u201cAs it was a matter of life and death, I personally executed six of the would-be murderers, as witnessed by Flame Section Leader Garrick Tavis and T ail Section Executive Of ficer Bodhi Durran.\u201d \u201cBoth Tyrs. How convenient,\u201d Nadine, one of our new additio ns to the squad, says from the row behind Ridoc and Liam.I look back over my shoulder and pin her with a glare.

  "This is about to get ugly . \u201cI call you to answer for your crime against Cadet Sorrengail.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s focus shifts to the center of the formation. \u201cW ingleader Amber Mavis.\u201d The quadrant draws a collective breath before an uproar rips through the crowd. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Dain bites out. My chest tightens. Gods, I hate it when Dain proves me right. Rhiannon reaches for my hand, squeezing tight in support as every rider in the courtyard\u2019 s attention pivots between Xaden, Amber\u2026and me.",
  "\u201cShe\u2019 s a Tyr, too, Nadine,\u201d Ridoc says over his shoulder . \u201cOr are you only biased against marked ones?\u201d Amber \u2019s family stayed loyal to Navarre, so she wasn\u2019 t forced to watch her parents executed and wasn\u2019 t marked by a rebellion relic. \u201cAmber would never .\u201d Dain shakes his head. \u201cA wingleader would never .\u201d He turns comp letely to face me. \u201cGet up there and tell everyone that he\u2019s lying, V i.\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019 s not,\u201d I say as gently as I can. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d His cheeks flush a mottled shade of red. \u201cI was there, Dain.\u201d The reality of his disbelief hurts so much more than I expected, like a blow to my already battered ribs. \u201cWingleaders are beyond reproach\u2014\u201d \u201cThen why are you so quick to call our own wingleader a liar?\u201d My brows rise in challenge, daring him to say what he\u2019s so careful to keep quiet.Behind him, Amber steps forward, separating herself from the formation. \u201cI have committed no such crime!\u201d \u201cSee?\u201d Dain swings his arm, pointing toward the redhead. \u201cPut a stop to this right now , Violet.\u201d \u201cShe was with them in my room ,\u201d I say simply .",
  "Shouting won\u2019 t convince him. Nothing will. \u201cThat\u2019 s impossible.\u201d He lifts his hands, as though ready to cup my face. \u201cLet me see.\u201d The shock of what he intends to do has me stumbling backw ard. How have I for gotten that his signet allows him to see others\u2019 memories? But if I let him see my memory of Amber \u2019s participation, it will also show him that I stopped time, and I can\u2019t let that happen. I shake my head and take another step back. \u201cGive me the memory ,\u201d he orders. Indignation lifts my chin.",
  "\u201cTouch me without permission, and you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life regretting it.\u201d Surprise ripples over his features. \u201cWingleaders.\u201d Xaden projects his voice over the chaos. \u201cWe need a quorum.\u201d Both Nyra and Septon Izar\u2014the wingleaders for First and Second Wing \u2014climb the stairs to the dais, passing by Amber as she stands utterly exposed in the courtyard. A famili ar chao s fills the air, and we all look toward the ridgeline as six dragons curve along the mountain, flying straight for us. The biggest among them is T airn. In a matter of seconds, they reach the citadel and hover over the courtyard walls. Wind from the strong beats of their wings blasts through the courtyard. Then, one by one, they land on their perch, Tairn at the center of the grouping. Every line of his frame exudes menace as his talons crush the masonryunder his grip, and his narrowed, angry eyes focus on Amber . Sgaeyl is perched to the right, taking her position behind Xaden. She\u2019s just as terrifying as she was that first day, but back then I\u2019d never imagined I\u2019d bond a dragon even more frightening\u2026to everyone but me.",
  "Nyra\u2019 s Red Scorpiontail looms behind her as well, and Septon\u2019 s Brown Daggertail mirrors the stance to the left. On the ends, puffing blasts of steam, are Commandant Panchek\u2019 s Green Clubtail and Amber \u2019s Orange Daggertail.",
  "\u201cShit\u2019 s about to get real,\u201d Sawyer says, breaking formation to stand at my side, and I feel Ridoc at my back. \u201cYou can stop this all right now, Violet. You have to,\u201d Dain implores. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you saw last night, but it wasn\u2019 t Amber . She cares too much about the rules to break them.\u201d And she thinks I broke them by using my dagger on the last ascent of the Gauntlet. \u201cYou\u2019re using this to get your revenge on my family!\u201d Amber shouts at Xaden. \u201cFor not supporting your father \u2019s rebellion!\u201d That\u2019 s a low fucking blow . Xaden doesn\u2019 t even acknowledge it as he turns to the other wingleaders. He isn\u2019t demand ing proof like Dain. He believes me, and he\u2019s ready to execute a wingleader on nothing more than my word. As surely as if they\u2019re a physical structure, I feel my defenses crack on Xaden\u2019 s behalf. \u201cCan you see my memories?\u201d I ask T airn. \u201cShar e them?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d His head snake s left and right ever so slightly .",

  "Tairn chuffs and every dragon besides Sgaeyl stiffens on the wall, even Amber \u2019s. The riders are quick to follow , silence filling the courtyard, and Iknow they know . \u201cThat spineless wretch,\u201d Rhiannon seethes, her hand squeezing mine even tighter . Dain pales. \u201cBelieve me now?\u201d I hurl it like the accusation it is. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be my oldest friend, Dain. My best friend. There\u2019 s a reason I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d He staggers backward. \u201cThe wingleaders have form ed a quorum and are in unanimous agreement,\u201d Xaden announces, flanked by Nyra and Septon while the commandant hangs back. \u201cW e find you guilty , Amber Mavis.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d she shout s. \u201cIt is no crime to rid the quadrant of the weak est rider! I did it to protect the integrity of the wings!\u201d She paces in panic, looking to everyone\u2014anyone for help. As a whole, the formation moves backward.",
  "\u201cAnd as is our law , your sentence will be carried out by fire,\u201d Nyra states. \u201cNo!\u201d Amber looks to her dragon. \u201cClaidh!\u201d Amber \u2019s Orange Daggertail snarls at the other dragons and lifts a claw . Tairn swivels his massive head toward Claidh, his roar shaking the ground beneath my feet. Then he snaps his teeth at the smaller orange, and she retreats, her head hanging as she grips the wall again. The sight breaks my heart, not for Amber but for Claidh. \u201cDo you have to?\u201d I ask T airn. \u201cThis is our way .\u201d \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d I beg, forgetting to think the words. It\u2019s one thing to punish Amber , but Claidh will suf fer as well. Maybe I could talk to Amber . Maybe we can still work through our issues. Maybe we can find comm on ground, turn our anger to friendship or at least casual indifference. I shake my head, my heart pounding in my throat.",
  "I did this. I was so focus ed on whether anyone would believe me, Ididn\u2019 t stop to think what might happen if they did. I turn to Xaden and beg again, my voice breaking by the end. \u201cPlease give her a chance.\u201d He holds my gaze but doesn\u2019 t so much as show a flicker of emotion. \u201cI let someone live once, and he almost killed you last night, Silver One,\u201d Tairn says. Then , as if this is all that really matters in the end, \u201cJustice is not always mer ciful.\u201d \u201cClaidh,\u201d Ambe r whimpers, the courtyard so unbelievably silent that the sound carries. The formation splits at the center .",
  "Tairn leans low, extending his head and neck past the dais toward where Amber stands. Then his teeth part, he curls his tongue, and he incinerates her with a blast of fire so hot, I can feel it from here. It\u2019 s over in a heartbeat. A gruesome scream rends the air, shattering a window in the academic wing, and every rider slams their hands over their ears as Claidh mourns.Don\u2019t fr eak out if you can\u2019t immediately channel your dragon\u2019 s powers, Mira. Y eah, I know you have to be the best at everything, but this isn\u2019t something you can contr ol. They\u2019ll channel when they feel you\u2019r e ready . And once they do, you\u2019d better be r eady to manifest a signet. Until then, you\u2019r e not r eady . Don\u2019t push it. \u2014P AGE SIXTY -ONE, THE BOOK OF BRENNAN CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \u201cThis really isn\u2019t necessary .\u201d I glance sideways at Liam as we make our way toward the door of the Archives. The cart doesn\u2019 t even squeak anymore. He fixed that the very first day . \u201cSo you\u2019ve told me for the last week.\u201d He shoots me a grin, revealing a dimple. \u201cAnd yet you\u2019re still here.",
  "Every day. All day.\u201d It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like him. To my absolute annoyance, he\u2019s actually\u2026nice. Courteous, funny , and ridiculously helpful. He makes it difficult to loathe his consta nt presence, even though he leaves wood shavings in little piles everywhere he goes\u2014 which is everywhere I go now. The guy is constantly whittling with that smaller knife of his. Y esterday he finished the figurine of a bear . \u201cUntil otherwise ordered,\u201d he says. I shake my head at him as Pierson jolts upright at the Archiv es doors, straightening his cream tunic. \u201cGood morning, Cadet Pierson.\u201d \u201cYou as well, Cadet Sorrengail. \u201d He offers me a polite smile, which dies as he glances at Liam. \u201cCadet Mairi.\u201d \u201cCadet Pierson,\u201d Liam responds, as if the scribe\u2019 s tone hadn\u2019 t completely changed.My shou lders tense as Pierson hurries to open the door. Maybe it\u2019s just that I haven\u2019 t been around marked ones before Basgiath, but the outright hostility toward them is becoming glaringly , uncomfortably obvious to me. We walk into the Archives and wait by the table just like every other morning.",
  "\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d I ask Liam in a hushed whisper . \u201cHan dle when people are that rude without reacting?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re rude to me all the time,\u201d he teases, drumming his fingers on the handle of the cart. \u201cBecause you\u2019re my babysitter , not because\u2026\u201d I can\u2019 t even say it. \u201cBecause I\u2019m the son of the disgraced Colonel Mairi?\u201d His jaw ticks, his brow furrowing for a heartbeat as he looks away . I nod, my stomach sinking as I think back over the last few months. \u201cI guess I\u2019m really no better , though. I hated Xaden on sight, and I didn\u2019 t know a single thing about him.\u201d Not that I do now, either . He\u2019s infuriatingly good at being completely inaccessible. Liam scoffs, earning us a glare from a scribe near the back corner.",
  "\u201cHe has that effect on people, especially women. They either despise him for what his father did or want to fuck him for the same reason, just depends on where we are.\u201d \u201cYou actually know him, don\u2019t you? \u201d I crane my neck to look up at him. \u201cHe didn\u2019 t just pick you to shadow me because you\u2019re the best in our year .\u201d \u201cJust now catch ing on, huh?\u201d A grin flashes across his face. \u201cI would have told you that on the first day if you hadn\u2019 t been so busy huffing and puffing about the pleasure of my company .\u201d I roll my eyes as Jesinia appro aches, her hood up over her hair. \u201cHey , Jesinia,\u201d I sign. \u201cGood morning, \u201d she signs back , her mouth curving in a shy smile as her gaze darts up to Liam. \u201cGood morning.\u201d He signs with a wink, clearly flirting.It shocked me to my toes that first day that he knew how to sign, but honestly , I\u2019d been a little judgy just because I didn\u2019 t want a shadow . \u201cJust these today?\u201d Jesinia asks, inspecting the cart. \u201cAnd these.\u201d I reach for the list of requests amid their obvious glances and hand it to her . \u201cPerfect.\u201d Her cheeks flush and she studies the list before puttin g it in her pocket.",
  "\u201cOh, and Professor Markham left before his daily report arrived to teach your briefing. W ould you mind taking it over?\u201d \u201cHappy to.\u201d I wait until she\u2019s pushing the cart away from us, then smack Liam\u2019 s chest. \u201cStop it,\u201d I whisper out loud. \u201cStop what?\u201d He watches her until she turns the corner at the first set of shelves. \u201cFlirting with Jesinia. She\u2019s a long-term-relationship woman, so unless that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for\u2026just\u2026don\u2019 t.\u201d His eyebrows hit his hairline. \u201cHow does anyone think long-term around here?\u201d \u201cNot everyone is in a quadrant where death is less of a chance and more of a foregone conclusion.\u201d I breathe in the scent of the Archives and try to absorb a little of the peace it brings. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that some people still try to make cute little things like plans.\u201d \u201cExactly , and those some people is Jesinia. Trust me, I\u2019ve known her for years.\u201d \u201cRight. Because you wanted to be a scribe when you grew up.\u201d He scans the Archives with an intensity that almost makes me laugh. As if there\u2019 s any chance someone is going to lunge out of the shelves and come after me.",
  "\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d I lower my voice as a group of second-years passes, their expressions sombe r as they debate the merits of two different historians. \u201cI did my research on you after I was\u2026you know\u2026assigned.\u201d He shakeshis head . \u201cI\u2019ve seen you practicing this week with those blades of yours, Sorrengail. Riorson was right. Y ou would have been wasted as a scribe.\u201d My chest swells with more than a little pride. \u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d At least challenges haven\u2019 t resumed. Guess enough of us are dying during flight lessons to hold off on killing more through hand-to-hand . \u201cWhat did you want to be when you grew up?\u201d I ask, just to keep the conversation going. \u201cAlive.\u201d He shrugs. Well, that\u2019 s\u2026something. \u201cHow do you know Xaden anyway?\u201d I\u2019m not foolish enough to think that everyone in the province of T yrrendor knows one another . \u201cRiorson and I were fostered at the same estate after the apostasy ,\u201d he says, using the T yrrish term for the rebellion, which I haven\u2019 t heard in ages. \u201cYou were fostered?\u201d My mouth drops open. Fostering the children of aristocrats was a custom that died out after the unification of Navarre more than six hundred years ago.",
  "\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d He shrugs again. \u201cWhere did you think the kids of the traitors\u201d\u2014he flinches at the word\u2014\u201cwent after they executed our parents?\u201d I look out over the sprawling shelves of texts, wondering if one of them holds the answer . \u201cI didn\u2019 t think.\u201d My throat catches on that last word. \u201cMost of our great houses were given to nobles who had remain ed loyal.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cAs it should be.\u201d I don\u2019t bother agreeing with what\u2019 s obviously a conditioned reply . King Tauri\u2019s response after the rebellion was swift, even cruel, but I was a fifteen-year -old girl too lost in her own grief to think mercifully on the people who\u2019d caused my brothe r\u2019s death. The burning of Aretia , which had been Tyrrendor \u2019s capital, to the ground had never sat well with me, though. Liam was the same age. It wasn\u2019 t his fault his mother had broken faith with Navarre. \u201cBut you didn\u2019 t go with your father to his new home?\u201d His gaze swings toward mine, and his brow furrows. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to livewith a man who was executed on the same day as my mother .\u201d My stom ach sinks. \u201cNo. No, that\u2019s not right. Your father was Isaac Mairi, right?",
  "I\u2019ve studied all the noble houses in every province, including Tyrrendor .\u201d Had I gotten something wrong? \u201cYes. Isaac was my father .\u201d He tilts his head, looking toward the area where Jesinia disappeared, and I get the distinct feeling he is over this conversation. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019 t a part of the rebellion.\u201d I shake my head, trying to make sense of it. \u201cHe isn\u2019 t on the death roll of the executions from Calldyr .\u201d \u201cYou read the death roll from the Calldyr executions?\u201d His eyes flare. It takes all my courage, but I hold his stare. \u201cI needed to see that someone was on it.\u201d He draws back slightly . \u201cFen Riorson.\u201d I nod. \u201cHe killed my brother at the Battle of Aretia.\u201d My mind scrambles, trying to harmon ize what I\u2019ve read and what he\u2019s saying. \u201cBut your father wasn\u2019 t on that roll.\u201d But Liam was\u2014as a witness. Mortification sweeps over me. What the hell am I doing?",
  "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry . I shouldn\u2019 t have asked.\u201d \u201cHe was executed at our family\u2019 s house.\u201d His features tighten. \u201cBefore it was given to another noble, of course. And yes, I watched as they did it that time, too. I already had the rebellion relic by then, but the pain was the same.\u201d He looks away , his throat working. \u201cThen I was sent to Tirvainne to be fostered by Duke Lindell, the same as Riorson. My little sister was sent elsewhere.\u201d \u201cThey separated you?\u201d My jaw practically unhinges. Neither fostering nor separating siblings is mentioned in any text I\u2019ve read about the rebellion, and I\u2019ve read a ton. He nods. \u201cShe\u2019 s only a year younger than me, though, so I\u2019ll get to see her when she enters the quadrant next year. She\u2019s strong, quick, and has good balance. She\u2019ll make it.\u201d The edge of panic in his tone reminds me of Mira.\u201cShe could always choose anoth er quadrant,\u201d I say softly , hoping it will soothe him. He blinks at me. \u201cW e\u2019re all riders.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all riders. It was part of the deal.",
  "We\u2019re allowed to live, allowed a chance to prove our loyalty , but only if we make it through the Riders Quadrant.\u201d He stares at me in bewilderment. \u201cY ou don\u2019 t know?\u201d \u201cI mean\u2026\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI know that the children of the leaders, the officers, were all forced into conscription, but that\u2019s all. A lot of those treaty addenda are classified.\u201d \u201cI perso nally think the quadrant was chosen to give us the best chance of rising in rank, but others\u2026\u201d He grimaces. \u201cOthers think it\u2019s because the death rate is so much higher for riders, so they were hoping to kill us all off without having to do it themselves.",
  "I \u2019 ve heard Imogen say they originally figured the dragons have unimpeachable honor , so they \u2019 d never bond a marked one in the first place , and now they don \u2019 t quite know what to do with us. \u201d \u201c How many of you are there ? \u201d I think of my mother and can \u2019 t help but wonder how much of it she knows , how much of it she agreed to when she became the commanding general of Basgiath after Brennan \u2019 s death . \u201cXaden\u2019 s never?\u201d He pauses. \u201cSixty-eight of the officers had kids under the age of twen ty. There are one hundred and seven of us, all who carry rebellion relics.\u201d \u201cThe oldest is Xaden,\u201d I murmur . He nods. \u201cAnd the youngest is almost six now . Her name is Julianne.\u201d I think I\u2019m going to be sick.",
  "\u201cIs she marked?\u201d \u201cShe was born with it.\u201d I understand it was done by dragon, but what the fucking hell?",
  "\u201cAnd it\u2019s all right that you ask. Someone should know . Someo ne should remember .\u201d His shoulders rise and fall as he breathes deeply . \u201cAnyway , is ithard for you to be in here? Or is it more of a comfort thing?\u201d Subject change noted. I take in the rows of tables , slowly filling with scribes readying themselves for work, and imagin e my father among them. \u201cIt\u2019s like coming home, but not. And it\u2019s not that it\u2019s changed\u2014this place never changes. Hell, I think change is the mortal enemy of a scribe. But I\u2019m starting to realize that I\u2019ve changed. I don\u2019 t quite fit here. Not anymore.\u201d \u201cYeah. I get that.\u201d Something in his voice tells me he really does. It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue to ask what the last five years were like for him, but Jesinia reappears, the cart laden with the requested tomes. \u201cI have everythi ng here for you,\u201d she signs, then gestures to the scroll on top. \u201cAnd that is for Professor Markham.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure he gets it,\u201d I promise, leaning forward to take the cart. My high collar shifts, and Jesinia gasps, her hand flying to cover her mouth. \u201cOh gods, Violet.",
  "Your neck!\u201d Her hand movements are sharp , and the sympathy in her eyes makes my chest tighten. \u201cSympathy\u201d isn\u2019t a word found in our quadrant. There \u2019s rage, wrath, and indignation\u2026but no sympathy . \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d I put my collar back in place, covering the ring of yellowing bruise s, and Liam reaches across me, taking the cart. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you tomorrow .\u201d She bobs her head and wrings her hands as we turn for the door. Pierson closes it after we pass into the hallway . \u201cRiorson taught me to fight during the years he was at Tirvainne.\u201d Liam\u2019 s change of subject is appreciated and no doubt intentional once again. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyo ne move the way he does. He\u2019s the only reaso n I made it through the first round of challenges. He might not show it, but he takes care of his own.\u201d \u201cAre you trying to sell me on his finer points?\u201d We make the ascent, and I note with some satisfaction that my legs feel strong today . I love the dayswhen my body cooperates. \u201cYou are slightly stuck with him for\u2026\u201d He makes a face. \u201cW ell, forever .\u201d \u201cOr until one of us dies,\u201d I joke, but it falls flat as we round the corner and take the path past the Healer Quadrant.",
  "\u201cHow can you do this anyway? Guard someone whose own mother oversaw the wing that captured yours?\u201d I\u2019ve wanted to ask the question all week. \u201cWondering if you can trust me?\u201d He flashes another easy grin. \u201cYes.\u201d The answer is simple. He laughs, the sound echoing off the tunnel walls and glass windows of the clinic. \u201cGood answer .",
  "All I can say is that your survival is essential to Riorson\u2019 s, and I owe him everything. Everything .\u201d He looks me straight in the eye for that last word, even as the cart hits a raised stone in the paved corridor . The scroll on top tumbles to the floor , and I wince at the dull ache in my ribs as I hurry to retrieve it and it unrolls along the slight slope of the passage. \u201cGot it.\u201d The thick parchment isn\u2019t eager to roll back into place, and I catch a sentence that makes me pause. The conditions at Sumerton are of particular concern. A village was ransacked and a supply convoy looted last night \u2014 \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Liam asks. \u201cSumerton was attacked.\u201d I flip the scroll to see if it\u2019s marked as classified, but it isn\u2019 t. \u201cOn the southern border?\u201d He looks as confused as I feel. \u201cYeah.\u201d I nod. \u201cIt\u2019s another high-altitude attack, too, if I reme mber my geography correctly . It says a supply convoy was looted.\u201d I read a little further . \u201cAnd the community storage in nearby caves was ransacked. But that doesn\u2019 t make sense.

  "\u201cNo clue. Guess we\u2019ll hear about it in Battle Brief today .\u201dAttacks along our southern borders are rising, all with the same description. Mountain villages are being torn apart wherever the wards weaken. Immense, incredible hunger strikes, my stomach gnawing on emptiness that demands to be appeased with the blood of\u2014 \u201cSorrengail?\u201d Liam looks over at me, concern etched between his brows. \u201cTairn\u2019s awake,\u201d I manage to say, clutching my stomach like I\u2019m the one who craves a flock of sheep. Or goats. Or whatever he decides for the morning. \u201cGood gods, please go eat something.\u201d \u201cThe same could be suggested to you,\u201d he snarls. \u201cSuch a morning person, aren\u2019t you?\u201d The hunger dissipates, and I know it\u2019s because he\u2019s dampening the bond in that moment because I can\u2019t. His emotions only flow into me when they override his control. \u201cThank you. Andarna?\u201d \u201cStill sleeping. She\u2019ll be out another few days after using that much power .\u201d \u201cDoes it ever get any easier?\u201d I ask Liam. \u201cBeing tackled by what they\u2019re feeling?\u201d He winc es. \u201cGood question. Deigh keeps pretty good control of himself, but when he\u2019s angry?\u201d Liam shakes his head.",
  "\u201c It \u2019 s supposed to help once they start channeling and we have the power to shield them out , but you know Carr isn \u2019 t going to bother with us until that happens. \u201d I \u2019 d alrea dy assumed Liam didn \u2019 t have his abilities yet , considering he \u2019 s with me in every single class , but it \u2019 s comforting to know he \u2019 s still in the waning population of powerless riders with me .",
  "While Andarna has given me her gift for stopping time, I\u2019m pretty sure using it isn\u2019t going to be a regular occurrence, especially if it takes her days to recover . \u201cSo Tairn hasn\u2019 t channeled to you, either , right?\u201d Liam asks, a look of uncertainty , vulnerability on his face. I shake my head. \u201cI think he has commitment issues,\u201d I whisper . \u201cI hear d that.\u201d\u201cThen stay out of my head.\u201d Another wave of paralyzing hunger assaults me, and I nearly crush Markham\u2019 s scroll in my hand. \u201cDon\u2019 t be an ass.\u201d I swear I hear him chuf f a chuckle in response.",
  "\u201cWe\u2019d better hurry or we\u2019ll miss breakfast.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d I finish rolling the scroll and put it back on the cart. \u2026 \u201cI want to be like the cool kids,\u201d Rhiannon grumbles as first-years from Second and Third Wings pour out of the stairwell of the turret that leads up to Professor Carr\u2019s classroom that afternoon, further clogging the hallway on our way to Battle Brief. \u201cWe will,\u201d I promise, linking my arm through hers. Have to admit, there\u2019 s more than a little twinge of jealousy in my chest. \u201cYou may be cool, but you will never be as cool as I am!\u201d Ridoc pushes past Liam and throws his arm over my shoulder . \u201cShe\u2019 s talking about everyone who\u2019 s already channeling,\u201d I explain, juggling my books so I don\u2019t drop them. \u201cThough at least if we\u2019re not channeling, we\u2019re not stressed about manifesting a signet before the magic kills us.\u201d The relic in the cente r of my back tingles, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if Andarna\u2019 s gift has triggered that clock for me. \u201cOh, I thought we were discussing how I just owned that physics test.\u201d He grins. \u201cDefinitely the highest score in the class.\u201d Rhiannon rolls her eyes. \u201cPlease.",
  "I scored five points higher than you.\u201d \u201cWe stopped counting your grades months ago.\u201d He leans forward slightly . \u201cYour grades in that class make it unfair for the rest of us.\u201d He looks between our shoulders. \u201cW ait. What did you get, Mairi?\u201d \u201cNot getting into the middle of this,\u201d Liam responds. I laugh as we break apart, entering the bottleneck of cadets to get into the briefing room.\u201cSorry , Sorrengail,\u201d someone says, stepping out of the way and tugging their friend with them as we enter the tiered classroom. \u201cNothing to be sorry about!\u201d I call out, but they\u2019re already headed up a few rows. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get used to that.\u201d \u201cIt definitely makes getting places easier ,\u201d Rhiannon teases as we descend the steps that curve along the massive turret. \u201cThey show the appr opriate level of defer ence,\u201d Tairn grumbles. \u201cTo what they think I\u2019ll be, not who I am.\u201d We find our row and walk to our seats, sitting as a squad among the first-years. \u201cThat shows excellent for ethought.\u201d The room buzzes with energy as riders file in, and I can\u2019t help but notice that no one has to stand anymore. Our numbers have decreased exponentially in the last four months. The number of empty chairs is sobering.",
  "We lost another first-year yesterday when he got too close to another rider \u2019s Red Scorpiontail on the flight field. One second he was standing there, and the next he was a scorched patch of earth. I kept as close to Tairn as possible the rest of the session. My scalp prickles, but I fight the ur ge to turn around. \u201cRiorson just got here,\u201d Liam says from the seat to my right, breaking from the little dragon figurine he\u2019s carving and looking up the rows toward the third-years. \u201cFigured.\u201d I hold up my middle finger and keep my eyes forward. Not that I don\u2019 t like Liam, but I\u2019m still pissed at Xaden for assigning him. Liam snorts and grins, flashing his dimple. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s glaring. Tell me, is it fun pissing of f the most powerful rider in the quadrant?\u201d \u201cYou could try it yourself and find out,\u201d I suggest, opening my notebook to the next empty page. I can\u2019t turn around. I won\u2019 t. Wanting Xaden is fine.",
  "It has to be. Indulging the impulses it gives me? That\u2019 s asinine. \u201cThat\u2019 s going to be a no from me.\u201d I lose the battle with my self-control and look over my shoulder . Sureenough, Xaden is seated in the top row next to Garrick, mastering the art of looking bored. He gives Liam a nod, which Liam returns. I roll my eyes and face forward again. Liam concentra tes on his carving, which looks a lot like his Red Daggertail, Deigh. \u201cI swear , you\u2019d think there were assassination attempts on me during every class with the way he makes you shadow me.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIn his defense, people are fond of trying to kill you.\u201d Rhianno n sets out her supplies. \u201cOne time! It\u2019s happened one time, Rhi!\u201d I adjust my posture to keep my weight off my bruised ribs. They\u2019re wrapped tight, but leaning against the back of my seat isn\u2019 t an option.",
  "\u201cRight. And what would you call that whole thing with Tynan?\u201d Rhiannon asks. \u201cThreshing.\u201d I shrug. \u201cAnd Barlowe\u2019 s constant threats?\u201d She arches a brow at me. \u201cShe has a point there,\u201d Sawyer chimes in, leaning forward from the seat next to Rhiannon\u2019 s. \u201cThey\u2019re just threats. The only time I\u2019ve actually been targeted was at night, and it\u2019 s not like Liam here is sleeping in my bedroom.\u201d \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not opposed\u2014\u201d he begins, his knife hovering over the piece of wood. \u201cDon\u2019 t even start.\u201d I whip my head to face him and can\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cYou are a shameless flirt.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d He grins and goes back to carving. \u201cIt wasn\u2019 t a compliment.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t mind her, she\u2019s just sexually frustrated. Makes a girl crabby .\u201d Rhiannon writes the date down on her empty page and I follow suit, dipping my quill into my portable inkpot. Those easy, mess-less pens some of the others can already use is just another reason I can\u2019t wait to channel. Nomore quills. No more inkpots.",
  "\u201cThat has nothing to do with it.\u201d Gods, could she have said that a little louder? \u201cAnd yet I don\u2019 t hear you denying it.\u201d She smiles sweetly at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t make the cut,\u201d Liam teases. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure Riorson would be fine with my reviewing a couple candidates, especially if it means you\u2019ll stop flipping him of f in front of his entire wing.\u201d \u201cAnd how exact ly would you be reviewing candida tes? What will you be scoring?\u201d Rhian non asks, one eyebrow raised above her wide grin. \u201cThis I have to hear .\u201d I manage a straight face for all of two seconds before laughing at how horrified he suddenly looks.",
  "\u201cThanks for the offer, though. I\u2019ll make sure to run any potential liaisons by you.\u201d \u201cI mean, you could watch,\u201d Rhiannon continues, blinking innocently at him. \u201cJust to be sure she\u2019s fully covered. You know , so no one\u2026sticks it to her.\u201d \u201cOh, are we telling dick jokes now?\u201d Ridoc asks from Liam\u2019s side. \u201cBecause my entire life has led up to this very moment.\u201d Even Sawyer laughs. \u201cFuck me,\u201d Liam mutters under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that since you\u2019re protected at night now\u2014 \u201d We laugh harder , and he blows out a deep breath. \u201cWait.\u201d I stop laughing. \u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019m protected at night? Because you\u2019re next door?\u201d My smile vanishes. \u201cPlease tell me he\u2019s not making you sleep in the hallway or something obnoxious.\u201d \u201cNo. Of course not.",
  "He warded your door the morning after the attack.\u201d His expression clearly says I should know this. \u201cI\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019 t tell you?\u201d \u201cHe what ?\u201d \u201cHe warded your door,\u201d Liam says, quieter this time. \u201cSo only you canopen it.\u201d Shit. I don\u2019t know how to feel about that. It\u2019s more than slightly controlling, and way out of line, but also\u2026sweet. \u201cBut if he\u2019s the one who warded it, then he can get in, too, right?\u201d \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d Liam shrugs as Professors Markham and Devera walk down the stairs, heading for the front of the room. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like Riorson is going to kill you.\u201d \u201cRight. You see, I\u2019m still adjusti ng to that little change of heart.\u201d I fumble my quill and it falls to the ground, but before I can lean over, the shadows beneath the arm of my desk lift the instrument like an of fering. I pluck it out of the shadows and look back at Xaden. He\u2019s locked in conversation with Garrick, not paying me a speck of attention. Except, apparently , he is.",
  "\u201cIf we can get started?\u201d Markham calls over the room, and we fall silent as he places the scroll Liam and I had delivered to him before breakfast on the podium. \u201cExcellent.\u201d I write Sumerton down at the top of the page and Liam trades his knife for a quill. \u201cFirst announcement,\u201d Devera says, stepping forward. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided that not only will the winners of this year\u2019s Squad Battle recei ve bragging rights\u2014\u201d She grins like we\u2019re in for a treat. \u201cBut they\u2019ll also be given a trip to the front lines to shadow an active wing.\u201d Cheers break out all around us. \u201cSo if we win, we get a chance to die sooner?\u201d Rhiannon whispers. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re trying a reverse psychology thing.\u201d I glance at the others around us who are clearly overjoyed and worry about their sanity . Then again, most everyone in this room can stay on their dragon. \u201cSo can you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t you have better things to do with your day than listen in on myself-loathing?\u201d \u201cNot particularly . Now pay attention.\u201d \u201cStop butting in and maybe I can,\u201d I counter . Tairn chuffs. One day I might be able to translate that sound, but it\u2019s not today .",
  "\u201cI know the Squad Battle doesn\u2019 t commence until spring,\u201d Devera continues, \u201cbut I figured that news would give you all the proper motivation to apply yourselves in every area leading up to the challenges.\u201d Another cheer resounds. \u201cAnd now that we have your attention.\u201d Markham lifts his hand and the room quiets. \u201cThe front lines are relatively quiet today , so we\u2019re going to take this opportunity to dissect the Battle of Gianfar .\u201d My quill hovers above my notebook. Surely he didn\u2019 t say that.",
  "The mage lights rise to the Cliffs of Dralor that separate Tyrrendor , lifting the entire province thousands of feet above the rest of the Conti nent, before shining brightest on the ancient stronghold along the southern border . \u201cThis battle was pivotal to the unific ation of Navarre, and though it happened more than six centuries ago, there are important lessons that still impact our flight formations to this day .\u201d \u201cIs he serious?\u201d I whisper to Liam. \u201cYeah.\u201d Liam\u2019 s grip bends his quill. \u201cI think he is.\u201d \u201cWhat made this battle unique?\u201d Devera asks, her eyebrows raised. \u201cBryant?\u201d \u201cThe stronghold was not only set for a siege,\u201d the second-year says from high above us, \u201cbut was equipped with the first cross-bolt, which proved lethal against dragonkind.\u201d \u201cYes. And?\u201d Devera prompts. \u201cIt was one of the final battles where gryphons and dragons actually worked alongside each other to annihilate the army of the Barrens,\u201d the second-year continues.I glance left and right, watching the other riders begin to take notes. Surreal. This is just\u2026surreal. Even Rhiannon is writing intensely . None of them knows what we do, that an entire village of Navarrians was ransacked last night along the border and supplies looted.",
  "And yet, we\u2019re discussing a battle that happ ened before the convenience of indoor plumbing was invented. \u201cNow , pay close attention,\u201d Markham lectures. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll be turning in a detailed report in three days and drawing comparisons to battles from the last twenty years.\u201d \u201cWas that scroll marked classified?\u201d Liam asks under his breath. \u201cNo,\u201d I respond just as quietly . \u201cBut maybe I missed it?\u201d The battle map doesn\u2019 t even show activity near that mountain range. \u201cYeah.\u201d He nods, scratching his quill against the parchment as he begins to take notes. \u201cThat has to be it. Y ou missed it.\u201d I blink, forcing my hand through the motions of writing about a battle I\u2019ve analyzed dozens of times with my father . Liam\u2019 s right. That\u2019s the only possible explan ation. Our clearance isn\u2019t high enough, or maybe they haven\u2019 t finished gathering all the information needed to form an accurate report. Or it had to have been marked classified. I just missed it.The first rush of power is unmistakable. The first time it forms to you, surr ounds you with a seemingly endless supply of energy , you\u2019ll be addicted to the high, to the possibilities of all you can do with it, to the contr ol you hold in the palm of your hand. But her e\u2019s the thing, that power can quickly turn and contr ol you.",
  "\u2014PAGE SIXTY -FOUR , THE BOOK OF BRENNAN CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO The rest of November passes without mention of what happened at Sumerton, and by the time the howling winds bring snow in December , I\u2019ve given up hoping command will release the information. It\u2019s not like Liam or I can directly ask the professors without incriminating ourselves for reading what was obviously a classified report\u2014even if it wasn\u2019 t marked. It makes me wonder what else doesn\u2019 t make it to Battle Brief, but I keep that to myself. Between that and my growing frustration over my inability to chann el\u2014unlike three-quarters of my year\u2014I\u2019m keeping a lot to myself these days. \u201cNot entir ely,\u201d Tairn grunts. \u201cNo comments from you, not after you almost let me hit the side of a mountain today .\u201d My stomach churns just thinking about how far he let me fall. The first-year from Third Wing wasn\u2019 t as lucky . She lost her seat during a new maneuver and ended up on the death roll this morning.",
  "Rhiannon swings her bow staff, and I throw my weight into a backbend, narrowly escapin g the strike. To my absolute surprise, I keep my balance on the training mat.\u201cThen stay on next time.\u201d \u201cStart channeling and maybe I\u2019ll be able to,\u201d I counter . \u201cYou\u2019re distract ed tonight.\u201d Rhiannon backs off as I regain my balance, showing me mercy no opponen t would during a challenge. Her gaze flicks across the mat to where Liam sits on a bench, carving yet another dragon, and returns to mine, giving me a look that says she\u2019ll follow up later once I\u2019ve been released from my constant shadow for the night. \u201cBut you\u2019re faster than you used to be.",
  "Whatever Imogen has you doing is working.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not r eady to channel yet, Silver One.\u201d \u201cAs if there was ever any doub t,\u201d Imogen calls from the next mat over, where she casually holds Ridoc in a headlock, waiting for him to tap out. To my left, Sawyer and Quinn circle each other , preparing for yet another round, and behind Rhiannon, Emery and Heaton are doing their best to coach the other first-years we gained after Threshing while Dain looks on, studiously avoiding anything that has to do with me. Per his recent orders, Tuesday nights are for squad hand-to-hand practice, because the full academic load we\u2019re carrying, coupled with flight lessons and now wielding instruction for some of us isn\u2019t leaving much time for the mat. A few of the farther mats are taken up by other riders with the same idea, one of which includes Jack Barlowe. Hence why Liam refused when Ridoc asked to spar with him. \u201cYou\u2019re taking it easy on me,\u201d I tell Rhiannon. Sweat drips down my back, dampening the tight-fitted tunic I chose while my dragon-scale vest dries on the bench next to Liam.",
  "It\u2019s not like he needs extra practice. He\u2019s already taken everyone but Dain down to the mat, and part of me thinks that\u2019s only because Dain refuses to be bested by a younger rider . \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for an hour.\u201d Rhiannon swishes her staff through the air. \u201cYou\u2019re tired, and the last thing I want is to hurt you.\u201d \u201cChallenges resume after solstice,\u201d I remind her. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing meany favors by holding back.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019 s not wrong,\u201d a deep voice says from behind me. In my peripherals, I see Liam stand, and I mutter a curse under my breath. \u201cWell aware,\u201d I say over my shoulder as Xaden passes by our mat, accompanied by Garrick as usual. It\u2019s impossible to rip my eyes away until he passes, though. Gods, I have it bad. \u201cGo away unless you have something useful to say .\u201d \u201cMove faster . You\u2019ll be less likely to die.",
  "How\u2019 s that for useful?\u201d he calls back, taking up a position on a mat closer to the center of the sparring gym. Rhiannon\u2019 s eyes flare, and Liam shakes his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cThe way you talk to him,\u201d Rhiannon murmurs. \u201cWhat\u2019 s he going to do? Kill me?\u201d I charge forward, swinging my staff at her legs. She jumps over the attack and spins, bringing the staff against mine with a crack .",
  "\u201cYou\u2019re likely to kill each other ,\u201d Liam chimes in, taking his seat again. \u201cCan\u2019 t wait to see how you two function after graduation.\u201d After graduation. \u201cHaven\u2019 t let myself think past this week, let alone all the way to graduation.\u201d Not when there are some very difficult questions I\u2019m not ready to ask. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re\u2026aggrav ated by how long it\u2019s taking Tairn to channel,\u201d Rhian non says, circling me on the mat again. \u201cI\u2019m just saying on this mat with me is a way safer place for you to take out that anger than the giant, shadow-wielding wingleader .\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to take any of my anger out on you. You\u2019re my friend.\u201d I gesture loosely toward Xaden. \u201cHe\u2019 s the one who stuck me with a shadow I can\u2019t shake because he thinks I\u2019m his weakness . But does he help me?\u201d I lash out with the staff, and she counters. \u201cNo. Does he train me?\u201d Anotherlunge, another clash of our staf fs. \u201cNo. He\u2019 s remarkably good at showing up when I\u2019m about to die and eliminating threats, but that\u2019s it.\u201d He sure as hell doesn\u2019 t have a problem keeping his eyes of f me the way I do him.",
  "\u201cSo there\u2019 s definitely some anger there,\u201d Rhiannon drawls as she spins away easily . \u201cYou would be furious if someone took your freedom away . If you had Liam at your door every morning until every night, even as seem ingly great as he is.\u201d I dodge one of her attacks. \u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Liam butts in, proving my point. \u201cYeah,\u201d she agrees. \u201cI would. And I\u2019m pissed on your behalf. Now , let\u2019s put that anger to use.\u201d Rhiannon rains another series of moves down on me and I keep up, but only because she\u2019s doing exactly what I accused her of and taking it easy on me. Then I make the mistake of glancing over her shoulder , toward the center of the gym. Holy . Fucking. Hot. Xaden and Garrick have stripp ed off their shirts and are sparring like their lives depend on it, a blur of kicks, punches, and rippling muscle. I\u2019ve never seen two people move that fast. It\u2019s a beautiful, hypnotizing dance with lethal choreography that makes me hold my breath whenever Garrick goes in for the kill and Xaden deflects. I\u2019ve seen countless riders spar without their shirts these past months. This is nothin g new.",
  "I should be absolutely immune to the male form, but I\u2019ve never seen him shirtless. Every edge of Xaden\u2019 s body is honed like a weapon, all sharp lines and barely leashed power . His rebellion relic twists around his upper body and stands out again st the deep bronze of his skin, accentuating every punch he throws, and his stomach\u2026 I mean, how many muscles are there in the abdominals? His are so rigidly defined that I could probably count every single one if the rest of him wasn\u2019t so damned distracting. And he has thelargest dragon relic I\u2019ve ever seen. Mine consumes the skin between shoulder blades, but Sgaeyl\u2019 s mark takes up his entire back. And I know exactly how that body feels on top of mine, just how much power\u2014 My hip stings, knocking me out of my trance, and I startle. \u201cServes you right,\u201d Tairn lectures. \u201cPay attention!\u201d Rhiannon yells, drawing back her staff. \u201cI could have\u2026 Oh.\u201d Clearly , she sees what I do, what nearly every other woman\u2014and several of the men\u2014are happily watching. How can we not when the two of them are mesmerizing?",
  "Garrick\u2019 s wider , more densely packed with muscle than Xaden, his rebellion relic only extending to his shoulder , the second largest I\u2019ve seen. Only Xaden\u2019 s reaches his carved jawline. \u201cThat is\u2026\u201d Rhiannon murmurs beside me. \u201cIt sure is,\u201d I agree. \u201cStop objectifying our wingleader ,\u201d Liam teases. \u201cIs that what we\u2019re doing?\u201d Rhiannon asks, not bothering to look away . My mouth wate rs at the muscle d expanse of his back and that sculpted ass. \u201cY eah, I think that\u2019 s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Liam snorts. \u201cWe could just be watching for technique.\u201d \u201cYeah. We absolutely could be.\u201d But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m shamelessly wondering how his skin would feel under my fingertips, how my body would react to having every ounce of that intense focus on me. Heat races through my veins and stings my cheeks. A repetitive smacking sound draws my attention to the right, where Ridoc is tapping out with zeal.",
  "Imogen drops him , leaving him gasping for breath on the mat , and an unwanted and absolutely illogical flash of ugly , twisted jealousy stabs me straight in the chest at the pure yearning she can \u2019 t hide in her expression as she watches Xaden and Garrick. \u201c If you guys are this easily distracted , we \u2019 re fucked for the Squad Battle , \u201d Dain barks . \u201cY ou can kiss any thought of visiting the front lines goodbye.\u201d We all snap out of it, and I shake my head like that might clear the dizzying need that demands I do more than look at Xaden, which is just\u2026 ridiculous.",
  "He only tolerates my existence because our dragons are mated, and here I am salivating over his half-naked body . It\u2019s a really nice half-naked body , though. \u201cGet back to work. We have another half hour,\u201d Dain orders, and I feel like he\u2019s talking directly to me, which would be the first thing he\u2019s said since my memory got Amber killed. \u201cShe got herself killed by br eaking the Codex,\u201d Tairn growls. Sure enough, when I glance his way, Dain\u2019 s eyes are narrowed on me, but I must be reading his face wrong. Surely that\u2019 s not betrayal pursing his lips. \u201cShould we?\u201d Rhiannon asks, lifting her staf f. \u201cYep, we defini tely should.\u201d I roll my shoulders, and we start again. I match her move for move, using the patterns she taught me, but she switches up the next attack. \u201cStop defending and go on offense!\u201d Tairn demands, his anger flooding my system and throwing of f my footwork. Rhiannon sweep s low and flips me onto my back, knocking the wind out of me as I collide with the mat. I fight for air that isn\u2019 t there.",
  "\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry , Vi.\u201d Rhiannon drops down to a knee beside me. \u201cJust relax and give it a second.\u201d \u201cAnd yet that is the rider Tairn chose,\u201d Jack mocks, talking to someone in his squad as he grins maliciously at the edge of the mat. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think he chose wrong, but considering I haven\u2019 t seen you wield any powers, I bet you\u2019re thinking the same thing, too, aren\u2019 t you, Sorrengail? Shouldn\u2019 t you have twice the ability to channel with two dragons?\u201d It doesn\u2019 t work like that with Andarna, but none of them know that.Liam stands, putting himself between Jack and me as the first trickle of air dances into my lungs. \u201cSimmer down, Mairi.",
  "I\u2019m not going to attack your little charge. Not when I can just challenge her in a couple of weeks and accide ntally snap her scrawny neck in front of an audience.\u201d Jack folds his arms across his chest and watches me struggle with pure pleasure. \u201cT ell me, though, you are getting tired of playing the nursemaid, aren\u2019 t you?\u201d His friend from First Wing offers him something\u2014a slice of the orange he\u2019s eating\u2014and Jack shoves his hand away at the wrist. \u201cGet that noxious shit away from me. Do you want me to end up in the infirmary?\u201d \u201cWalk the fuck away , Barlowe,\u201d Liam warns, dagger in hand.",
  "I manage one breath, then two as Jack\u2019 s gaze rises from me to someone standing behind me. That look on his face, half envy , half shitting himself, means it has to be Xaden. \u201cShe\u2019 s only alive because of you,\u201d Jack spits, but the blood drains from his face. \u201cRight, because I\u2019m the one who buried a dagger in your shoulder at Threshing.\u201d Finally breathin g somewhat normally , I scramble for my feet, clutching the staf f with both hands. \u201cWe could just settle this now,\u201d Jack says, sidestepping Liam to look me in the eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019re done hiding behind the big, strong men.\u201d My stom ach hollows out because he\u2019s right. The only reason I don\u2019t accept his challe nge is because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll win, and the only reason he isn\u2019t attacking me is because of Liam and Xaden. If I attack Jack now, they\u2019ll kill him. Garrick\u2019 s hulking frame appears to the left, and I begrudgingly add him to my list of protectors. Hell, even Imogen has inched closer , but not on my behalf. It\u2019s only on his.",
  "\u201cThat\u2019 s what I thought,\u201d Jack says, blowing me a kiss.\u201cYou ran,\u201d I snarl, wishing I could lunge forward and beat the shit out of him, but forcing my feet to stay planted where they are. \u201cThat day in the field, you fucking ran when it was three on one, and we both know when it comes down to it, you\u2019ll run again.",
  "That\u2019 s what cowards do.\u201d Jack flushes, his eyes nearly bugging out of his face. \u201cOh, for fuck\u2019 s sake, V iolet,\u201d Dain mutters. \u201cShe\u2019 s not wrong,\u201d Xaden drawls. Garrick laughs, and Liam muscles Jack off the mat when he leaps at me. Jack\u2019 s boots squeak against the hardwood floor as he unsuccessfully fights to hold his ground, and Liam forces him from the gym. With a flick of his hand, Xaden shuts the huge doors with his power , locking Jack out. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking, egging him on like that?\u201d Dain marches toward me, disbelief raising his brows. \u201cOh, now you feel like talking to me?\u201d I lift my chin, but it\u2019s Xaden who fills my vision as he steps between us. The fury in his eyes is palpable, but I don\u2019t retreat. \u201cGive us a second.\u201d His gaze is locked on mine, but we both know he\u2019s not talking to me.",
  "My pulse skitters. Rhiannon steps back. \u201cYou want to tell me why the fuck you\u2019re not wearing that?\u201d His tone is soft but deadly as he points toward the bench where my armor lies. \u201cI have to wash it at some point.\u201d \u201cAnd you thought that would be a good idea during sparring ?\u201d His chest heaves, like he\u2019 s battling to keep control of himself. I\u2019m just trying not to notic e his chest or the heat he\u2019s throwing off like a damned furnace. \u201cI washed it befor e sparring , know ing it could dry while your guard dog keeps watch, as opposed to sleeping without it because we both know what happens behind locked doors around here.\u201d\u201cNot behind yours anymore.\u201d His jaw ticks. \u201cI made sure of it.\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019m supposed to trust you?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d A vein in his neck bulges. \u201cAnd you make it so easy .\u201d Sarcasm drips from my voice. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t kill you. Fuck, Sorrengail, the entire quadrant knows I can\u2019t kill you.\u201d He leans into my space, eclipsing the rest of the room. \u201cThat doesn\u2019 t mean you can\u2019 t hurt me.\u201d He blinks and shifts backward, composing himself in less than a heartbeat while mine still races.",
  "\u201cStop training with a bow staff. It\u2019s too easy to knock out of your hands. Stick to the daggers.\u201d To my surprise, he doesn\u2019 t snatch it away just to prove he can. \u201cI was doing just fine until Tairn barged into my head with all his anger and distracted me,\u201d I ar gue, my defenses rising like the hackles of a dog. \u201cThen learn how to block him out.\u201d He says it like it\u2019 s just that simple. \u201cWhat, with all this power I\u2019m wielding?\u201d My brows rise. \u201cOr were you unaware that I\u2019m still not channeling?\u201d I want to throttle him, to shake some ever -loving sense into that beautiful head of his. He leans in so we\u2019re almost nose to nose. \u201cI am annoyingly aware of everything you do.\u201d Thanks to Liam. Every inch of my body vibra tes with anger , with irritation, with\u2026 whatever this electric tension is between us as we stand there, our eyes locked in combat. \u201cWingleader Riorson,\u201d Dain starts. \u201cShe\u2019 s just not used to the bond yet. She\u2019ll learn how to block it out.\u201d Dain\u2019 s words sting like a blow . I inhale sharply and step back from Xaden. Good gods, we\u2019ve been putting on a fucking show .",
  "What is it about Xaden that makes me tune out the rest of the world? \u201cYou choose the oddest times to defend her, Aetos.\u201d Xaden all but rolls his eyes as he looks at Dain. \u201cAnd the most convenient times not to.\u201dDain\u2019 s jaw clenches and his hands curl into fists at his sides. He\u2019s talking about Amber . I know it. Dain knows it. Everyo ne in this whole, awkward room knows it. Our entire squad was there when Dain demanded I call Xaden a liar . Xaden turns those unfathomable eyes back on me. \u201cDo us both a favor and put the fucking armor back on,\u201d he finishes. Before I can counter , he turns and walks off the mat, meeting Garrick at the edge. His back. My quiet gasp is uncontrollable , and Xaden tenses for a second before taking his shirt from Garrick \u2019 s outstretched hand and tugging it over his head , covering the navy-blue",
  "relic of a dragon that sweeps from his waist to over both should ers\u2014textured intricately with raised silver lines I couldn \u2019 t see from across the gym . Silver lines I instantly recognize as scars. \u201cYou held your own and contr olled your temper ,\u201d Tairn says, an immense swell of pride flooding my chest. \u201cShe\u2019 s ready,\u201d Andarna adds with a giddy jolt of joy that makes me instantly light-headed. \u201cShe\u2019 s ready,\u201d he agrees. \u2026 A couple of hours later, I rip my brush through my hair in the privacy of my room, still fully dressed down to my boots and armor . I still can\u2019t believe I made an ass of myself in front of my entire squad simply because Xaden decided to train shirtless. I really need to get laid. I pause mid-brushstroke when a rush of energy races down my spine, dissipating in a heartbeat.",
  "Well, that\u2019 s\u2026weird.Maybe it\u2019s\u2026 No. It can\u2019t be. It felt completely different when Andarna stopped time through me. That was a full-body flood that expanded through my fingers and toes, then\u2026left afterward. Another wave ripples through me, stronger this time, and I drop the brush, clutching the edge of the dresser so I don\u2019t fall as my knees threaten to buckl e. The energy doesn\u2019 t dissipate this time; it sticks around, humming under my skin, ringing in my ears, overwhelming every sense. Something within me expands, somehow too big for my own body , too vast to be contained, and pain sears every nerve as I crack open, the sound reverberating through my skull like bones shattering. It\u2019s as though I\u2019ve been split at the very seams of the fabric of my being. My knees hit the floor , and I throw my hands over my temples, trying to shove everything I am back into my skull, forcing myself to shrink. Energy pours in\u2014a deluge of raw, endless power\u2014eroding everything I was and forging something completely new as it fills every pore, every organ, every bone. My head screams, and it feels like Tairn has flown too high too fast and I can\u2019t pop my ears.",
  "All I can do is lie there on the floor and pray the pressure equalizes. I stare at my brush, the hardwood floor biting into my cheek, and breathe. In and then out. In\u2026and then out\u2026surrendering to the onslaught. Finally , the pain ebbs, but the energy\u2014the power\u2014doesn\u2019 t. It\u2019s simply\u2026 there, prowling through my veins, saturating every cell in my body . It is everything I am and everything I can be all at once. I sit up slowly and flip my hands to examine my tingling palms. It feels like they should look different, changed, but they\u2019re not. They \u2019re still my fingers, my slender wrists, and yet they\u2019re so much more now. They\u2019re strong enough to shape the torrent inside me, to mold it into whatever I desire. \u201cThis is your power , isn\u2019t it?\u201d I ask Tairn, but he doesn\u2019 t answer .\u201cAndarna?\u201d There\u2019 s only silence. Go figure, they\u2019re always around, pushing into my head when I could use a little space, then nowhere to be found when it\u2019s the other way around. I\u2019d heard them say I was ready earlier , but I figured it would take a day or two for my mind to fully open that pathway once Tairn started channeling.",
  "Guess not. Rhiannon. I have to tell Rhianno n. She\u2019s going to flip that I can finally go to Professor Carr\u2019s class with her. And Liam? He can stop pretending that he can\u2019 t channel just so he isn\u2019 t forced to leave me for an hour a day . Heat washes over me, prickling my skin and centering low in my stomach. Odd, but whatever . It\u2019s probably just a side effect of the powe r. I throw open the lock on my door and yank it open. My vision blurs and need slam s into me, robbing me of every logical thought besides satiating the overwhelming\u2014 \u201cViolet?\u201d The fuzzy shape of a man stands in the hallway , and I blink Liam into focus. \u201cY ou all right?\u201d \u201cAre you sleepi ng in the hallway?\u201d I grip the doorframe as an image of falling fills my mind, and I feel the sizzle of flakes as they make contact with my heated skin. It\u2019s gone as quickly as it appeared, but the driving, thundering desire remains. Oh shit. This is\u2026lust.",
  "\u201cNo.\u201d Liam shakes his head. \u201cJust hanging out here before turning in.\u201d I look at him then. Really , honestly look at him. He\u2019s more than handsome, with strong features and sky-blue eyes that are startlingly beautiful. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d He sets his knife and semi-carved dragon down. \u201cLike what?\u201d My teeth sink into my bottom lip and I debate rubbingagainst him like a cat in heat while demanding he appease this unimaginable ache. But he\u2019 s not who you r eally want. He\u2019s not Xaden. \u201cLike\u2026\u201d He cocks his head to the side. \u201cLike something\u2019 s going on. You don\u2019t look like you feel\u2014you know\u2014like yourself.\u201d Oh shit. It\u2019s because I\u2019m not myself. All of this, the need, the lust, the craving for the one person who I\u2019m meant to be with\u2026it\u2019 s Tairn. Tairn\u2019s emotions aren\u2019 t just overwhelming me; they\u2019re controlling me. \u201cI\u2019m good!",
  "Go to bed!\u201d I step back into my room and slam the door while I still have the mental capacity to do so. Then I start pacing, but that doesn\u2019 t stop the next blast of heat or the compulsion to\u2014 I have to get out of here before I make an epic mistake and take Tairn\u2019s feelings out on Liam. Grabbing my fur-lined cloak in one hand and pulling my hair up with the other , I swirl the fabric over my shoulders and fasten the clip beneath my throat. A second later, I peek out the door, and when I\u2019m sure the coast is clear , I fucking flee. I make it to the entrance of the spiral steps\u2014the ones that lead to the river \u2014before I have to lean back against the stone wall and breathe through the fog of T airn\u2019s emotions. Once the wave passes, I race down the steps, keeping one hand on the wall in case I\u2019m pulled under again. The mage lights flicker on as I approach and fizzle out as I race by, as though this newfound power is already at work, stretching into the world. Away. I have to get away from everyone until Tairn finishes\u2026whatever he and Sgaeyl are doing. I stumble out of the stairwell and emer ge at the foundation walls of thecitadel.",
  "Snow fills the sky, and I tip my head back, savoring the brief kiss of snowflakes on skin that\u2019 s heated for all the wrong reasons. The air is crisp and chilled, and\u2014 My eyes pop open at the scent in the air and I whirl, my cloak whipping out behind me as I find the source of the sweet, easily identifiable smoke. Xaden is leanin g back against the wall, one foot braced on the stone, smoking and watching me like he doesn\u2019 t have a care in the world. \u201cIs that\u2026churam?\u201d He blows out a puff of smok e. \u201cWant some? Unless you\u2019re here to continue our earlier ar gument, in which case, none for you.\u201d My jaw practically unhinges. \u201cNo! W e\u2019re not allowed to smoke that!\u201d \u201cYeah, well, the people who made that rule obviously weren\u2019 t bonded to Sgaeyl and T airn, now were they?\u201d A smirk lifts a corner of his mouth.",
  "Gods, I could stare at his lips forever . They are perfectly shaped and yet entirely too decadent for the slashing line of his jaw . \u201cIt helps with\u2026distancing yours elf.\u201d He offers me the rolled churam and cocks an eyebrow at me\u2014the one with the scar. \u201cBeyond what shielding does, of course.\u201d I shake my head and cross through the newly fallen snow to brace my weight on the wall beside him, letting my head fall back against the stone. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He inhales deeply on the churam and then puts it out against the wall. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m on fucking fire.\u201d That\u2019 s putting it mildly . \u201cYeah. That happens.\u201d His laugh holds a wicked edge, and I make the utterly unfor givable mistake of turning to see his smile. Xaden, while brooding and bossy , dangerous and lethal, is a toe-curling sight that makes my pulse quicken. But Xaden laughing, his head thrown back with a smile curving his mouth, is drop-dead beautiful. My stupid, foolish heart feels like there\u2019 s a fist around it, squeezing tight. There is nothing I wouldn\u2019 t sacrifice, nothing I wouldn\u2019 t give to have oneunguarded mom ent with this man I\u2019m going to be tethered to for the rest of our lives.",
  "This has to be T airn. It just\u2026has to. And yet, I know it isn\u2019t. While I\u2019d admired Liam upstairs, I am completely , utterly obsessed with Xaden. His eyes meet mine in the moonlight. \u201cOh, Violence, you\u2019re going to have to learn to shield against Tairn or his escapades with Sgaey l will drive you mad\u2014or into someone\u2019 s bed.\u201d I squeeze my eyes shut just so I can escape his gorgeous face as a jolt of heat flashes through me, makin g every inch of my skin tingle and burn. I reach a hand out to steady myself against the wall again. \u201cOh, I know .",
  "I am horrified to see Liam again.\u201d \u201cLiam? Why?\u201d He pivots to face me, leaning against his shoulder . \u201cWhere the hell is your bodyguard?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m my own bodyguard,\u201d I counter , resting my cheek on the icy stone. \u201cAnd he\u2019 s in bed.\u201d \u201cYour bed?\u201d His voice is like a crack of lightning. I pry my eyes open to meet his gaze. The snow makes everything so much brighter , highlighting the furrowed line of his brow , the firm set of his mouth. \u201cNo. Not that it should matter to you.\u201d Is he jealous? That\u2019 s\u2026oddly comforting. He looses a breath, his shoulders dipping. \u201cIt doesn\u2019 t matter to me as long as you\u2019re both consenting, and trust me, you\u2019re in no condition to consent.\u201d \u201cYou have no clue what I\u2019m capable of consenting\u2014\u201d Undeniable, unquenchable need nearly takes me out at the knees. Xaden\u2019 s arm wraps around my waist, steadying me. \u201cWhy the hell aren\u2019 t you shielding?\u201d \u201cNot all of us have been given lessons! He just started channeling before all\u2026this, and in case you forgot, you\u2019re only allowed to atten d Professor Carr\u2019s class if you can wield.\u201d\u201cAlways though t that was a ridiculous rule.\u201d He sighs. \u201cAll right.",
  "Crash course. Only because I\u2019ve been where you are and woken up with more than a few regrets.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re actually going to help me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been helping you for months .\u201d His hand flexes at my waist, and I swear I can feel the warmth of his touch through my cloak and leathers. \u201cNo, you sent Liam to help. He\u2019s been helping me for months.\u201d My forehead puckers. \u201cW eeks. Almost months. Whatever .\u201d He has the nerve to look offended. \u201cI\u2019m the one who burst through your door and killed everyone who attacked you, and then I removed the other threat to your life with a very public, very polarizing display of vengeance. Liam didn\u2019 t do that. I did.\u201d \u201cThe crowd wasn\u2019 t polarized. They were all for it. I was there.\u201d \u201cYou were torn. In fact, you begge d Tairn not to kill her, damn well knowing she\u2019d just come after you again.\u201d That point was still debatable. \u201cFine. But let\u2019s not pretend that you didn\u2019 t do most of that for yourself. It would be inconv enient for you if I died.\u201d I shrug, blatantly poking at him to help ignore the rising tide of lust thundering through me. He stares at me with disbelief . \u201cYou know what?",
  "We\u2019re not fighting tonight. Not if you want to learn how to shield.\u201d \u201cFine. We\u2019re not fighting. Teach me.\u201d I tilt my chin. Gods, I barely reach his collarbone. \u201cAsk me nicely .\u201d He leans closer . \u201cHave you always been this tall?\u201d I blurt the first thing that comes to mind. \u201cNo. I was a child at some point.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cAsk me nicely , Violence,\u201d he whispers. \u201cOr I\u2019m gone.\u201d I can feel Tairn at the edge of my mind, his emotions ebbing and flowing,and know the next wave is going to hit hard. How freaking long can those two possibly take? \u201cHow often is it like this with them?\u201d \u201cOften enough that you\u2019re going to need proper shields. You won\u2019 t ever be able to block them out completely , and sometimes they forget to block us, like tonight. That\u2019s why the churam helps, but at least it\u2019s like walking by a brothel instead of actively participating in one.\u201d Well\u2026shit.",
  "\u201cRight then. All right. W ill you teach me to shield?\u201d A smile curves his mouth, and my gaze drops to his lips. \u201cSay please.\u201d \u201cAre you always this dif ficult?\u201d \u201cOnly when I know I have something you need. What can I say, I like making you squirm. It\u2019s like a sweet little slice of payback for what you\u2019ve put me through these last coupl e of months.\u201d He brushes the snow off my hair. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve put you through?\u201d Unbelievable. \u201cYou\u2019ve scared me nearly to death once or twice, so I think saying please is a fair request.\u201d Like he\u2019s ever played fair a day in his life. I take a deep breath and swat at a snowflake that lands on my nose. \u201cAs you prefer . Xade n?\u201d I smile sweetly up at him and inch a little closer . \u201cWould you pretty , pretty please teach me how to shield before I accidentally climb you like a tree and we both wake up with regrets?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m firmly in control of my faculties.\u201d He smiles again, and I feel it like a caress. Dangerous. This is so damned dangerous. Heat flushes my skin, so hot that I debate tossing my cloak to the ground just to get a little relief.",
  "Notably , Xaden isn\u2019 t wearing one. \u201cAnd since you asked so nicely .\u201d He adjusts his stance and brings both his hands up to my cheeks, cradling my face before sliding them back to hold my head. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d \u201cIt requires touching me?\u201d My eyes flutter shut at the sensation of hisskin against mine. \u201cNot at all. Just one of the perks of not thinking too clearly . You have incredibly touchable skin.\u201d The compliment makes me suck in a breath. So much for contr olling his faculties.",
  "\u201cYou need to envision somewhere. Anywhere. I prefer the top of my favorite hillside near what\u2019 s left of Aretia. Wherever it is, it needs to feel like home.\u201d The only place I can think of is the Archives. \u201cFeel your feet hit the ground and dig in some.\u201d I imagin e my boots on the polished marble floor of the Archives and wiggle them a little. \u201cGot it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s called grounding, keep ing your mental self somewhere so you aren\u2019 t swept away by the power . Now call to your power . Open your senses.\u201d My palms begin to tingle, and a flood of energy surrounds me, just as saturating as it was in my bedroom but without the pain. It\u2019s everywher e, filling the Archi ves and pushing at the walls, making them bow and bend, threatening to break them. \u201cT oo much.\u201d \u201cFocus on your feet. Stay grounded. Can you see where the power flows from? If not, just pick a place.\u201d I turn in my mind.",
  "The barrage of molten power is flowing through the door. \u201cI see it.\u201d \u201cPerfect. You\u2019re a natural. It takes most people a week just to learn how to ground. Now , do whatever you need to mentally do to wall yourself off from that current. Tairn is the source. You block that power , and you\u2019ll have some control back.\u201d The door. I just need to close the door and twist the enormous , circular handle that seals the Archives of f for fire control. Desire makes my heart pound, and I grab on to Xaden\u2019 s arms, anchoringmyself in reality . \u201cYou\u2019ve got this.\u201d His voice sounds strained. \u201cWhatever you create in your mind is real to you. Shut off the valve. Build a wall. Whatever makes sense.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a door.\u201d My fingers dig into the soft material of his tunic, and I mentally heave myself against the door , forcing it shut one inch at a time. \u201cThere you go. Keep going.\u201d My physical body trembles at the effort it takes to mentally shove the door closed, but I get it there. \u201cI\u2019ve got the door shut.\u201d \u201cGreat. Lock it.\u201d I imagine spinning the giant handle and hearing the locks click into place. The relief is immediate, a cool blast of snow against my feverish skin.",
  "Power pulses, turning the door clear . \u201cIt changed. I can see through the door.\u201d \u201cYeah. Y ou\u2019ll never be able to fully block him. Got it locked?\u201d I nod. \u201cOpen your eyes, but do your best to keep that door locked. It means keeping one foot grounded. Don\u2019t be surprised if it slips. We\u2019ll just start again.\u201d I open my eyes, keeping that mental picture of the shut Archives door, and while my body is still heated and flushed with warmth, that inescapable, driving need is blessedly\u2026somewhat muted. \u201cHe\u2019 s\u2026\u201d I can\u2019t find the right words. Xaden studies me with an intensity that makes me sway toward him. \u201cYou are astonishing.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019 t do that for weeks .\u201d \u201cGuess I have a superior teache r.\u201d The emotion swelling through me is more than joy. It\u2019s euphoria that has me grinning like a fool. I\u2019m finally not only good at something, but astonishing . His thum bs stroke over the soft skin under my ears, and his gaze drops to my mouth and heats. Hands flexing, he draws me forward a few inchesbefore he suddenly lets go and retreats a full step. \u201cDamn it.",
  "Touching you was a bad idea.\u201d \u201cThe worst,\u201d I agree, but my tongue skims my lower lip. He groans and my core melts at the soun d. \u201cKissing you would be a cataclysmic mistake.\u201d \u201cCalamitous.\u201d What would it take to hear that groan again? The inches between us feel like kindling, ready to burn at the first suggestion of heat, and I\u2019m a living, breathing flame. This is everything I should run from , and yet denyin g the primal attraction I feel is completely , utterly impossible. \u201cWe\u2019ll both regret it.\u201d He shake s his head, but there\u2019 s more than hunger in his eyes as he stares at my lips. \u201cNaturally ,\u201d I whisper . But knowing I\u2019ll regret it doesn\u2019 t stop me from wanting it\u2014wanting him. Regretting is a problem for future V iolet. \u201cFuck it.\u201d One second he\u2019s out of reach and the next his mouth is on mine, hot and insistent. Gods, yes.",
  "This is exactly what I need. I\u2019m trapped between the immovable stone of the wall and the hard lines of Xaden\u2019 s body , and there\u2019 s nowhere else I\u2019d rather be. The thought should sober me, but all I do is lean in for more. He tunnels a hand through my hair, cradling the back of my head, angling me for a deeper kiss, and my lips part eagerly . He takes the invitation, sliding his tongue along mine with expert, teasing strokes that have me clutching at his chest, fisting the material of his shirt to pull him closer as desire dances up and down my spine. He tastes like churam and mint, like everything I\u2019m not supposed to want and yet can\u2019t help needing, and I kiss him back with everyth ing I have, sucking on his lower lip and scraping my teeth over him. \u201cViolence,\u201d he moans, and the sound of the nickname on his lips makesme ravenous. Closer . I need him closer . As though he can hear my thoughts, he kisses me harder , claim ing every line and curve of my mouth with a reckless edge that makes my body sing. He\u2019s just as needy as I am, and when he shifts his grip to my ass and picks me up, I wrap my legs around his waist and hold on like my life depends on this kiss never ending.",
  "The wall digs into my back, but I don\u2019t care.",
  "My hands are finally in his hair and it\u2019s just as soft as I imagined. He kisses me until I feel thoroughly devoured and explored, and then he sucks my tongue into his mouth so I can do the same. This is complete and utter madness, and yet I can\u2019t stop. Can\u2019 t get enough. I could live forever in this tiny slice of insanity if it means keeping his mouth on mine, leaving my world narrowed to the heat of his body and the skilled stroke of his tongue. His hips rock into mine, and I gasp at the delicious friction. He breaks the kiss, sliding his mouth across my jaw, my neck, and I know I\u2019ll do anything to keep him here with me. I want to feel his mouth everywher e. We\u2019re a tangle of tongues and teeth, questing lips and hands as the snow falls around us, and the kiss consumes me the same way the power had before, so thoro ughly I can feel it in every cell in my body . Need pulses between my thighs, and I jolt at the simple knowledge that there\u2019 s nothing he could do that I wouldn\u2019 t welcome. I want him. Only him. Here. Now . Anywhere. Whenever . I\u2019ve never been this out of control over a single kiss. Neve r wanted someone the way I do him.",
  "It\u2019s exhilarating and terrifying at the same time because I know that in this moment, he has the power to break me. And I\u2019d let him. I surrender completely , melting into him, my body going pliant against his and losing that mental foothold he calls grounding. A flash of lightburns behind my closed eyes, followed by the boom of thunder . Thunder - snow isn\u2019t uncommon around here, but damn does it summarize how this feels, wild and out of control. But then he breaks the kiss with a sharp gasp, his brow furrow ing with something akin to panic before he slams his eyes shut. I\u2019m still struggling to draw a full breath when he abruptly steps away from the wall and palms the backs of my thighs, setting me on my feet again. He makes sure I\u2019m steady and then retreats a few feet, like the distance will save his life. \u201cYou have to go.\u201d His words are clipped and at odds with the heat in his eyes, his ragged breaths. \u201cWhy?\u201d The cold is a shock to my system without his body heat. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t.\u201d He rakes both hands through his hair and leaves them on the top of his head. \u201cAnd I refuse to act on desire that isn\u2019t yours.",
  "So you have to walk back up those steps. Now .\u201d I shake my head. \u201cBut I want\u2014\u201d Everything. \u201cThis isn\u2019 t your want.\u201d He tilts his head up at the sky. \u201cThat\u2019 s the fucking problem. And I can\u2019t leave you out here on your own, so have just a little mercy on me and go.\u201d Silence ices over between us as I get ahold of myself. He\u2019 s saying no. And the shitty part about it isn\u2019t the chill of chivalrous rejection. It\u2019s that he\u2019s right .",
  "This started because I couldn\u2019 t tell Tairn\u2019s emotions from my own. But those emotions are gone, aren\u2019 t they? My door is wide open, and I don\u2019t feel anything coming from T airn\u2019s direction. I manage a nod, and then I flee for the second time tonight, climbing the steps as quickly as possible to get back to the citadel. My shields are open, but I don\u2019t bother stopping to shut that mental door, since Tairn isn\u2019t barging through. Common sense prevails by the time I reach the top, my thighs burning from the workout. Xaden stopped us from making a huge mistake.But I didn\u2019 t. What the hell is wrong with me? And how could I have been a heartbeat away from ripping off my clothes to get closer to someone I don\u2019t like and even worse\u2014can\u2019 t fully trust? It\u2019s harder than it should be to keep moving in the direction of my dorm room when all I want is to go right back down those stupid freaking steps. Tomorrow is going to suck.The most worrisome sight for any instructor is most definitely when powers backfir e. W e lost nine cadets my first year to signets that could not be contr olled fr om their first manifestation. Pity .",

My clock has started. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you managed to wait this long to tell me.\u201d She lifts the canvas strap over her head and turns, leaning back against her desk. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not judgm ent.

He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u201d My brow furrows, my imagination running through the thousand different consequences of what I did last night just like it has been all morning. \u201cSecond though ts?\u201d She tilts her head, studying me. \u201cYou look like maybe there are third thoughts, even.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWell, maybe? But only if it makes stuff between us weird.\u201d \u201cRight.",
  "Because you\u2019re stuck with him for the rest of your caree rs. Lives, too.

Wingleaders always get to pick.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll get to pick,\u201d I grumble, toying with an errant string on my satchel. \u201cI will have to follow . Tairn and Sgaeyl haven\u2019 t been separated for years . Her last rider died almost fifty years ago, and as far as I know, she flew wherever and whenever she wanted to be near Tairn before Naolin\u2014his last rider\u2014died in Tyrrendor . It\u2019s a two-day flight to that part of our border , depending on where he\u2019s statio ned, so what are we going to do next year and the year after?\u201d Her lips purse. \u201cNot sure. Feirge said we won\u2019 t be able to be apart more than a couple of days, so does that mean one of you has to always follow the other?\u201d \u201cNo clue. I think that\u2019s why most mated pairs bond within the same year, so they don\u2019t have these issues.",
  "How am I supposed to remain competitive next year if I\u2019m constantly flyin g off to the front line with Tairn? How is Xaden supposed to be effective if he has to fly back here all the time?\u201d My face scrunches. \u201cHe\u2019s the most powerful rider of our generation.

It\u2019s Tairn. He\u2019s even mastered his snarl. \u201cThis is\u2026incredible. Thank you.\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d Liam gives me a grin, flashing his dimple. \u201cI wanted to carve Andarna first, but I\u2019m not around her as much, you know?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019 s pretty private.\u201d We break off from the crowd headed to the fourth floor , and I stash the dragon in my bag, then reach out and give him a hug.\u201cReally , I love it.

  "Xaden is standin g with the other wingleaders, locked in what looks to be a tense discussion, his arms folded across his chest. It took the commandant all of five minutes to appoint Lamani Zohar as wingleader for Third Wing after Amber was executed, but since she was already executiv e officer, it made the most sense. I\u2019ll never get over how quickly people move on around here, how callously death is swept under a rug and trampled on minutes later . Gods, Xaden looks good today , his brow slightly furrowed as he listens intently to something Lamani says, then nods. Hard to believ e I had that mouth on mine last night, those arms wrapped around me. Forget second thoughts. I just want more. As if he feels me staring, Xaden lifts his head, his gaze colliding with mine across the space with the same effect as a touch. My pulse skitters and my lips part. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Rhi reminds me, glancing back over her shoulder .",
  "Xaden looks behind me, and his mouth tenses. \u201cVi, can we talk?\u201d Dain asks, a little out of breath, like he\u2019s run to catch up to me. \u201cNow?\u201d I rip my gaze from Xaden\u2019 s and turn to face the person I thought was my best friend. Dain grimaces, rubbing a hand behind his neck, and nods. \u201cI tried to catch you after formation, but you disappeared pretty quickl y, and after what happened last night, I figure now is better than later .\u201d\u201cIt might be convenient for you to want to talk after weeks of ignoring me, but I have class right now .\u201d I grip the strap of my satchel. \u201cWe have a couple of minutes.\u201d The plea in his eyes is so heavy that I feel the weight of it on my chest. \u201cPlease.\u201d I glance at Rhiannon, who is glaring at Dain with her true feelings for once, instead of the deference owed him as our squad leader . \u201cI\u2019ll be right in.\u201d She glances at me and then nods, heading into Carr\u2019s room with the rest of our squad. I follow Dain out of the doorway , to a place along the wall where we won\u2019 t obstruct traf fic. \u201cYou let Tairn share your memory with everyone instead of just showing me yourself,\u201d he blurts, his hands falling to his sides.",
  "\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d What the hell is he talking about? \u201cWhen all that shit went down with Amber , I asked you to show me what happened, and you refused.\u201d He shifts his weight, just one of his nervous tells, and the motion strips away some of my anger . When push comes to shove, he\u2019s my oldest friend, even if he\u2019s being an ass. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe you, and that part is on me.\u201d He raises his hand over his heart. \u201cI should have believed you, but I couldn\u2019 t reconcile the woman I knew with what you were saying, and you didn\u2019 t come find me after the attack, either .\u201d Hurt laces his tone. \u201cI had to hear about it in formation, Vi. Regardless of the fight we had on the flight field, you\u2019re still\u2026 you to me. And my best friend had been viciously attacked, nearly killed, and you didn\u2019 t say a single word about it.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019 t ask,\u201d I say softly . \u201cYou reached for my head like you were entitled to my memory after blatantly telling me you didn\u2019 t believe me, and you demanded I show you.\u201d It\u2019 s everything I can do to keep my voice even. Two lines appear between his eyebrows.",
  "\u201cI didn\u2019 t ask?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019 t ask.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cAnd after being told countless times that I\u2019m not tough enough for this place, not strong enough\u2026well, what happened on the flight field was a long time coming between you and me. The worst part is that I knew you wouldn\u2019 t believe me. It\u2019s why I almost didn\u2019 t tell Xaden who it was, because I was sure he wouldn\u2019 t believe me, either .\u201d \u201cBut he did.\u201d Dain\u2019s voice drops, and his jaw ticks. \u201cAnd he was the one who killed them in your bedroom.\u201d \u201cBecause Tairn told Sgaeyl.\u201d I fold my arms across my chest. \u201cNot because he was already there or anything. And I know you hate him\u2014\u201d \u201cYou have every reason to hate him, too,\u201d he reminds me, reaching for me before thinking better of it and drawing his hand back. \u201cI know that,\u201d I counter . \u201cHis father put an arrow in Brennan\u2019 s chest, according to battlefield reports. I live with that knowledge every day. But don\u2019t you think he sees me and remembers that my mother put his father to death?",
  "It\u2019s\u2026\u201d The right words are hard to find. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated between us.\u201d Images of last night flood my mind, from Xaden\u2019 s first smile to the last brush of his lips, and I shove them away . Dain flinches. \u201cYou trust him more than you trust me.\u201d It\u2019s not an accusation, but it stings all the same. \u201cThat\u2019 s not it.\u201d My stomach twists.",
  "Wait. Is it true? \u201cI just\u2026I have to trust him, Dain. Not with everything, of course.\u201d Shit, I\u2019m tying myself into knots here. \u201cNeither of us can do anything about Sgaeyl and Tairn being mated, and trust me, neither of us likes the situation, but we have to figure out a way through it. W e don\u2019 t have a choice.\u201d Dain mutters a curse, but he doesn\u2019 t disagree. \u201cI know you just want to keep me safe, Dain,\u201d I whisper . \u201cBut keeping me safe is keeping me from growing, too.\u201d He blinks at me, and something shifts between us. Like maybe, just maybe, he\u2019s finally ready to hear me. \u201cWhen you told me that this place strips everything away from you toreveal what\u2019 s underneath, I was afraid. What if underneath the brittle bones and frail ligaments, there was just more weakness? Only this time, I wouldn\u2019 t be able to blame my body .\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve never been weak to me, V i\u2014\u201d Dain starts, but I shake my head. \u201cDon\u2019 t you get it?\u201d I interrupt. \u201cIt doesn\u2019 t matter what you think\u2014it only matters what I think.",
  "And you were right. But the Riders Quadrant stripped away the fear and even the ange r about being thrown into this quadrant, and it revealed who I really am. At my core, Dain, I\u2019m a rider. Tairn knew it. Andarna knew it. It\u2019s why they chose me.",
  "And until you can stop looking for ways to keep me in a glass cage, we aren\u2019 t going to get past this, no matter how many years of friendship we have between us.\u201d He glances over my shoulder . \u201cAnd what? Riorson gets a free pass for his control issues? Because last time I checked, Liam was moved into our squad specifically to shadow you.\u201d It\u2019s an excellent point. \u201cLiam is around because even the strongest rider can\u2019t watch their back from more than thirty unbonded cadets gunning for them. And if I die, Xaden dies. What\u2019 s your excuse?\u201d Dain tenses like a statue, only the muscle in his jaw ticking before he eventually leans forward and whispers, \u201cLook, you don\u2019t know everything there is to know about Xaden, Vi. I have a higher security clearance due to my signet, and you need to be careful. Xaden has secrets, reasons to never forgive your mother , and I don\u2019 t want him to use you to get his revenge.\u201d My hackles rise. There\u2019 s a slive r of truth in what he\u2019s saying, but I don\u2019t have time to focus on the confusion that is Xaden right now. One screwed- up relationship at a time.",
  "I narrow my gaze as Dain shuffles his feet again, a kernel of a suspicion growing in my chest. \u201cWait, did you keep begging me to leave Basgiath because you didn\u2019 t think I could survive here\u2014or because you were trying to get me away from Xaden?\u201d I shake my head before he can answer . \u201cYou know what? It\u2019s irrelevant.\u201dAnd I mean it. \u201cYou only want to keep me safe. I appreciate that. But it stops now, Dain. Xaden is tied to me because of Sgaeyl. Nothing more. I do not need protection, and if I do\u2014I\u2019ve got two badass dragons who have my back.",
  "Can you respect that?\u201d He reaches up to cup my cheek , and I hold his gaze, determined for him to understand he either starts valuing my choices or we are never going to fix our friendship. \u201cAll right, Vi.\u201d His eyes crinkle at the sides as his mouth turns up into a half smile. \u201cHow can I argue with someone who has two badass dragons ?\u201d A weight shifts in my chest, and suddenly I can breathe again. I toss him a cheeky grin. \u201cExactly .\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not asking for the memory .\u201d He drops his hand to my shoulder . \u201cYou\u2019d better get to class.\u201d And then he squeezes my shoulder gently before walking away . I let out a shaky breath and turn back to the door for Carr\u2019s class. The hallway is empty . I head into Carr\u2019s room, a massi vely long chamber with padded walls and no windows.",
  "The entire length is lit by chandeliers of mage lights bright enough to emulate daylight over three dozen students from Third and Fourth Wing, who are seated in rows on the floor , evenly spaced to give one another the most room. Rhiannon and Liam meet me at the door and Professor Carr raises his bushy white brows at me when we approach where he\u2019s positioned at the front of the room, dominating the space by doing nothing more than standing there. The man isn\u2019 t just imposing, he\u2019 s intimidating as fuck. I swallow , remembering how he snapped Jeremiah\u2019 s neck. \u201cFinally ready to join us, Cadet Sorrengail?\u201d There\u2019 s no kindn ess in his eyes, merely shrewd, clinical observation. \u201cYes, sir .\u201d I nod. He studies me like I\u2019m a bug pinned to the wall in the biolo gy room.\u201cSignet power?\u201d \u201cNot yet.\u201d I shake my head, keeping the whole time-stopping thing to myself like Xaden suggested. You trust him more than you trust me. In this regard, Dain is right, and guilt drops my stomach.",
  "\u201cI see.\u201d He clucks his tongue, glancing over at me. \u201cYou know your siblings were both gifted by extraordinary signet powers. Mira\u2019 s ability to manifest a ward around her and her squad has been an absolute asset to her wing, and she\u2019 s been highly decorated for her valor behind enemy lines.\u201d \u201cYes. Mira is an inspiration.\u201d I force a smile, more than aware of my sister \u2019s prowess on the battlefield. \u201cAnd Brennan\u2026\u201d He looks away . \u201cMenders are so very rare, and to lose one so young was tragic.\u201d \u201cI think losing Brennan is the tragedy .\u201d I heft my satchel up higher on my shoulder . \u201cBut the loss of his signet was a definite blow to the wings.\u201d \u201cHmm.\u201d He blinks twice and turns his chilling gaze back on me. \u201cWell, it seems the Sorre ngail line is blessed, even in a rider as\u2026well, delicate as you are. With Tairn having chosen you, we\u2019ll expect nothing but an earth- shattering signet from you. Take a seat. You can at least start with the lesser magics through your relic.\u201d He waves me of f. \u201cNo pressure,\u201d I mutter as we walk to obviously empty places in the line with the rest of our squad. \u201cDon\u2019 t stress,\u201d Rhiannon says as we take our seats on the padded floor .",
  "\u201cThat\u2019 s what I was trying to remind you of earlier . You are T airn\u2019s rider .\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I set my satchel down next to me. \u201cYou\u2019re all worried about the integrity of the wing because Riorson might have to visit to keep his dragon happy but, Violet, he\u2019s not the most powerful rider of our generation. You are.\u201d She holds my gaze just long enough to let me know she means it. My heart lurches into my throat. \u201cNow let\u2019 s begin!\u201d Carr calls out.\u2026 December turns to January . Ground. Shield. Imagine closing your door. Build your wall. Sense who and what has access around you. Trace the bond to your dragon. Dragons in my case. Build a second entra nce\u2014a window\u2014into the archive of my power for Andarna\u2019 s golden ener gy. Block those bonds as far as you can. Visualize. Imagine a knot of power\u2014not too intricate; no one\u2019s ready for that yet\u2014 in front of you, then untangle it. Unlock the door . Visualize. Keep one foot firmly grounded at all times. You\u2019re useless unless you\u2019re connected to your power , and you\u2019re dangerous if you can\u2019t contain it. There is only the in-between that makes you a great rider .",
  "Envision your power like a hand, gripping that pencil and bringing it toward you. Pick it up. No. Not like that. T ry again. No, again. VISUALIZE. I study for tests. I prep for fligh ts. I lift weights with Imogen. I wonder how long Xaden is going to make me put in hours on the mat with Rhiannon. I win my first challenge, earning a dagger from a girl in Second Wing. But the most exhausting assignment is spending endless hours in the archive of my mind, learning which door is Tairn\u2019s and which belongs to Andarna, then working diligently to separate the two. It turns out that while my power might flow from my dragons, the ability to contro l it comes from my own exertion, and there are night s I fall into bed, plunging into sleep before I even remove my boots. By the end of the second week in January , I\u2019m not only pissed that Xaden hasn\u2019 t bothered to talk to me about that kiss but exhausted , and that\u2019s without a signet power manifesting, draining my ener gy to control it. Ridoc can wield ice, which might be a more common signe t, but it\u2019s impressive to see.Sawyer \u2019s metallur gy powers grow every day . Liam can see a single tree miles away .",
  "I guess I can stop time, but I\u2019m not willing to drain Andarna just for the sake of trying again, not when it took her more than a week of straight sleeping to recover . Without a signet, all I can wield are the lesser magics. I finally use an ink pen, lock a door , and open it. I\u2019m a party trick. By the third week in January , I earn yet another dagger in a challenge against a guy in Third Wing, my second without weakening my opponent with poisons. It leaves me with a sore wrist, but my joints are intact. And in the fourth week, during the coldest weather I\u2019ve ever experienced at Basgiath, I sneak out in the middle of the night to see the challenge board. Jack has finally been given the chance to end me on the mat tomorrow .",
  "\u201cHe\u2019 s going to kill me.\u201d That\u2019 s all I can think as I dress for the morning, sheathing all of my daggers in the most advantageous places. \u201cHe\u2019 s going to try .\u201d Tairn is up early . \u201cAny advice?\u201d I know Liam is waiting for us to make the library run before breakfast. \u201cDon\u2019 t let him.\u201d I scof f. He makes it sound so damned simple. We\u2019re already on our way back from the library when I finally work up the nerve to talk to Liam about it. \u201cIf I tell you something, will you report it to Xaden?\u201d His head whips in my direction as he pushes the cart over the bridge between the quadrants. \u201cWhy would you think\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, come on.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cWe both know you report just about everything I do. I\u2019m not ignorant.\u201d Snow pelts the windows, making a dull, chiming sound. \u201cHe worries. I alleviate worries .\u201d He glances at me again before looking forward. \u201cI know it\u2019s not fair. I know it\u2019s a breach of your privacy. But it\u2019snothing compared to what I owe him.\u201d \u201cYeah. I got that part.\u201d I hurry ahead and open the thick, heavy door into the citadel so he can pass throu gh.",
  "\u201cMaybe I should rephrase my question. If I were to tell you something and ask you specifically to keep this one thing between the two of us, would you agree? Are we friends, or am I just your assignment?\u201d He pauses while I shut the door, and I can tell he\u2019s thinking by the way he drums his fingers on the handle of the cart. \u201cWould me keeping it to myself alter your safety in any way?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I catch up to him and we start along the incline that will eventually split into two tunnels\u2014one toward the dormitory and the other toward commons. \u201cThere\u2019 s nothing you can do, and that\u2019 s the point.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re friends.

  "\u201cHe\u2019 s been asking since the first day, so it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019 t see this coming. Point is, Jack is going to challenge me today , and when he does, you can\u2019t step in, no matter what.\u201d His blue eyes widen. \u201cV i, if we tell Riorson, he can put a stop to it.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I reach for his hand and lay mine on top of it. \u201cHe can\u2019t.\u201d My stomach twists, but at least I\u2019m not puking like I did when I found out. \u201cThere\u2019 s only so much Xaden can do to protect me both here and once we\u2019re on the front lines. You and I both know that if he stops this, there will be an uproar in the quadrant after what happened to Amber .\u201d \u201cAnd you expect me to stand there and watch whatever happens\u2026happen?\u201d he asks, incredulous. \u201cJust like you have the last two challenges.\u201d I force another smile. \u201cDon\u2019 t worry . I\u2019m going to use everything I have to my advantage.\u201d And everything I have is currently in a vial tucked into the tiny pocket at my waist.",

I don\u2019t bother with breakfast, but I pay close attention to every single thing on Jack\u2019 s tray as I walk by, noting what\u2019 s there \u2026and what isn\u2019t. My heart pounds a chaotic, nauseating rhythm by the time all eighty-one of the surviving first-years gather in the gym. Professor Emetterio calls out the challenges one by one, assigning them to a mat.",
  "At least we\u2019ll all fight at once, which means not every rider will be watching. At least Xaden isn\u2019 t here, which means Liam kept his word. \u201cMat seventeen, Jack Barlowe from First Wing versus\u2026\u201d His eyebrows rise, and he takes a deep breath. \u201cV iolet Sorrengail.\u201d Thank gods Rhiannon\u2019 s already across the floor , ready to challenge a woman from Third Wing, so she doesn\u2019 t have to see how the blood drains from Liam\u2019s face. She shouldn\u2019 t have to see any of this. Sawyer \u2019s gone, too, over at mat nine. \u201cNo fucking way ,\u201d Ridoc mutters, shaking his head. \u201cFinally!\u201d Jack throws his hands in the air like he\u2019 s already won. \u201cLet\u2019 s do this.\u201d I roll my shoulders and head for the mat. Neither Liam nor Ridoc is called to the mat today , so they walk at my sides. \u201cTell me I can break the promise,\u201d Liam begs, and the pleading look in his eyes tells me exactly what a shitty position I\u2019ve put him in.\u201cThe third-years are off doing third-year things,\u201d I tell him as my toes touch the mat. \u201cYou can\u2019t get him here in time, but I know what it means to you to keep your word.",
  "Especially with him. Go ahead.\u201d He looks from me to Ridoc. \u201cGuard her like you\u2019re me.\u201d \u201cYou mean like I\u2019m six inches taller and built like a bull?\u201d Ridoc gives him a thumbs-up. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll do my best. In the meantime, you\u2019d better run.\u201d Liam\u2019 s gaze finds mine. \u201cStay alive.\u201d \u201cWorking on it, and not just for my sake.\u201d I give him a smile. \u201cThanks for being a great shadow .\u201d His eyes widen a split second before he sprints out of the gym. \u201cBarlowe and Sorrengail,\u201d Emetterio calls from the opposite side of the mat. \u201cW eapons?\u201d Jack bounces like a kid who\u2019 s just been given a gift. \u201cAnythin g she can hold in those puny hands of hers.\u201d The look in his eyes sends a shiver of apprehension down my spine. I step onto the mat, and Jack does the same, walking forward until we\u2019re at the center , facing each other . \u201cNo wielding,\u201d Emetterio remin ds us.",
  "\u201cTap out or knockout earns you a victory .\u201d Pretty sure everyone gathered around this mat knows that Jack isn\u2019t going for either of those options. If he gets his hands around my neck, I\u2019m dead. \u201cThat whole I-die-Xaden-dies thing is really just a hypothesis, right?\u201d I ask, unsheathing the daggers that are hardest to reach during a fight, the ones in my boots. \u201cOne I\u2019d rather not put to the test,\u201d Tairn growls. I stand, gripping the handles of my daggers, as Jack faces me with a single knife. \u201cY ou\u2019re kidding, right? Only one?\u201d \u201cI only need one.\u201d He grins with sickening excitement. \u201cGo for the gullet,\u201d Tairn suggests.\u201cI don\u2019t have the energy to block you out right now, so I\u2019m going to need you to be quiet for a few minutes her e.\u201d An answering growl is the only response I get. \u201cKeep it clean,\u201d Emetterio warns. \u201cGo.\u201d My heart drums so loudly , I can hear it in my ears as we begin to circle each other . \u201cOffense. Now .",
  "Strike first,\u201d Tairn snaps. \u201cNot helping!\u201d Jack lunges, striking out with his knife, and I slice my dagger across the back of his hand, drawing first blood. \u201cShit!\u201d He jumps back, his cheeks blotching. That\u2019 s what I want, what I need to win this match, for him to get so angry that he acts without thinking and makes a mistake. He dances forward and then kicks out, aiming for my midsection, and I stumble back, narrowly avoidin g the blow . \u201cBet you wish you could throw that blade, don\u2019t you?\u201d he taunts, knowing I won\u2019 t break a rule when it can hurt someone in the matches going on around us. \u201cBet you wish you didn\u2019 t know what it feels like to dig out one of my knives, don\u2019 t you?\u201d I retort. His lips press into a thin line before he comes at me in a series of punches and swipes with his dagger . I can\u2019t deflect\u2014he\u2019 s too strong for me, as evidenced by the dagger he easily kicks out of my hand\u2014s o I use my speed, ducking and diving while getting in another cut, this one along his forearm. \u201cDamn it!\u201d he rages, twisting to follow as I come around his back. He catches me off guard, locking onto my arm and flipping me over his back to the mat.",
  "I take the blow on my shoulder and wince, but there\u2019 s no sound of tearing or snapping. Thanking Imogen will be my first order of business if I make it out of this.Keeping my arm locked, Jack thrusts his knife straight at my chest, but it\u2019s deflected by my vest, skimming along my ribs to lodge in the mat. \u201cHe\u2019 s using death blows!\u201d Ridoc shouts. \u201cThat\u2019 s not allowed!\u201d \u201cPull it back, Barlowe!\u201d Emetterio bellows. \u201cWhat do you think, Sorrengail?\u201d Jack whispers in my ear, holding me immobile with my arm behind my back.",
  "\u201cAdmit it. You and I both knew it would be like this between us. Quick. Embarrassingly easy. Fatal. Your precious wingleader isn\u2019 t here to save you.\u201d No, but Xaden will suffer\u2026if not worse if Jack achieves his goal. The thought spurs me to action. Ignoring the pain, I throw my weight into a roll, subluxating my shoulder but freeing myself from his grip when he gets tangled in my legs. Then I kick him straight in the balls. He hits his knee s as I gain my feet, clutching himself as his mouth opens in a silent scream. \u201cTap out,\u201d I order , picking up the dagger I dropped. \u201cI can cut you open at any second. Both you and I know if this were real life, you\u2019d be done.\u201d \u201cIf this were real life, I would have killed you the second you stepped onto the mat,\u201d he seethes through gritted teeth.",
  "\u201cTap. Out.\u201d \u201cFuck of f!\u201d He throws his dagger . I throw up my hands to block, but it lodges in my left fucking forearm. Blood streams and pain sears the nerves along my arm, erupting with alarming poigna ncy, but I know better than to remove it. Right now, it\u2019s holding that wound as shut as it can. \u201cNo throwing!\u201d Emetterio shouts from the sidelines, but Jack is already moving, barreling toward me with a series of kicks and punches that I\u2019m not ready for . His fist slams into my cheek, and I feel the skin split. His knee forces the air from my body when he rams it into my stomach. But I stay on my feet until his hands clasp my face. Agony fills every cellin my body as violent, vibratin g energy rips through me with an intensity that makes it feel like he\u2019s cleaving ligament from bone, muscle from tendon. I scream as I\u2019m shaken by an internal force I don\u2019t understand, as though he\u2019s forcing his own power into my body , shocking me with a thousand stings of vibrating ener gy. Now . If I don\u2019t do it now, he\u2019ll kill me. My vision is already darkening at the edges.",
  "I reach a trembl ing hand into the pocket of my leathers and thumb open the stopper on the vial. His sadistic grin and a red rim around his eyes are all I can see as he forces more and more power into my body , but his hands are occupied and he\u2019s too obsesse d with his victo ry to hear that I\u2019ve stopped screaming, to see that I\u2019m moving. \u201cHe\u2019 s using his powers!\u201d Ridoc roars, and from the corner of my decreasing vision, I see movement on both sides. I shove the vial against Jack\u2019 s smile so hard, I feel one of his teeth break. Hands reach for us both, and I hear Ridoc and Emetterio cry out, jerking their hands away after contact. Whatever Jack is doing is transferring from me to them by touch. My teeth rattle as the pain consumes me, my body fighting to pass out, to escape the unbearable torture, but I refuse to succumb to the darkness until Jack wheezes. His eyes fly impossibly wide, and he drops his hands, clutching his own neck as his airway closes. My knee s give way, my body still shuddering as I hit the mat, but so does Jack, heaving and clawing at his neck as his face turns purple. Ridoc\u2019 s face is in mine within seconds.",
  "\u201cBreathe, Sorrengail. Just breathe.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with him?\u201d someone asks as Jack writhes.\u201cOranges,\u201d I whisper to Ridoc as my body finally gives out. \u201cHe\u2019 s allergic to oranges.\u201d I fall into nothingness. When I wake, I\u2019m not on the mat, and I can tell by the windows of the Healer Quadrant infirmary that night has fallen. I\u2019ve been out for hours. And that\u2019s not Ridoc lounged in the chair next to my bed, glaring at me like he\u2019d like to kill me himself. It\u2019s Xaden. His hair is tousled, like he\u2019s been tugging at it, and he\u2019s flipping a dagger end over end, catching it by the tip without so much as looking at it before sheathing it at his side. \u201cOranges?\u201dI know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but sometimes you have to know when to take the death blow , Mira. It\u2019 s why you have to be sur e that Violet enters the Scribe Quadrant. She\u2019ll never be able to take a life.",
  "\u2014P AGE SEVENTY , THE BOOK OF BRENNAN CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR I move to scoot up the bed so I can sit, but the pain in my arm reminds me that there was a dagger in it a couple of hours ago. Now it\u2019s bandaged. \u201cHow many stitches?\u201d \u201cEleven on one side and ninete en on the other .\u201d He arches a dark brow and leans forward, bracing his elbows on his knees. \u201cYou turned oranges into a weapon, V iolence?\u201d I wiggle to a sitting position and shrug. \u201cI worked with what I had.\u201d \u201cSeeing as it kept you alive\u2014kept us alive\u2014I can\u2019t really argue, and I\u2019m not going to ask how it is you always know who you\u2019ll end up challenging.\u201d There\u2019 s definite anger in that gaze but a touch of relief, too. \u201cTelling Ridoc allowed Emette rio to get him here in time.",

I didn\u2019 t mean to say that.\u201cThat\u2019 s not up for discussion.\u201d Something flashes in his eyes and is quickly replaced by a cool mask of indif ference. \u201cSeriously?\u201d I should know better , considering he\u2019 s avoided it this long. \u201cIt was a mistake.

But he had been just as into it as I was. I was there, and there was no mistakin g that kind of\u2026enthusiasm. But maybe it was the churam. \u201cWhat if I want to talk about it?\u201d \u201cThen feel free, but it doesn\u2019 t mean I have to be a part of the conversation. We\u2019re both allowed our boundaries, and this is one of mine.\u201d The finality in his tone makes my stomach curdle. \u201cI\u2019ll agree that keeping my distance didn\u2019 t work out so well, and if today\u2019 s little stunt was about getting my attention, then congratulations.

Most of the squads are in here, making use of the unexpected free time, so thankfully everyone is busy trainin g instead of watching us. \u201cBut you\u2019re armed.\u201d I glance pointedly to his sheaths. \u201cYou either trust me or you don\u2019t.\u201d He tilts his head to the side slightly , exposing more of the rebellion relic curving up around his neck. The same relic I caressed with my hand while he had me against the foundation wall more than a month ago.",
  "Nope. Not thinking about that . But my body has no problem remembering. I blow out my breath in a long sigh and step to the edge of the mat, unsheathing every dagger I own and the ones I\u2019ve won, then laying them on the floor . \u201cI\u2019m unarmed. Happy now?\u201d I turn to face him, putting my arms out. My long sleeve covers the bandage on my arm, but the throb is insistent. \u201cThough we probably could have waited a couple of days for my arm to heal up before doing this.\u201d The stitches pull, but I\u2019ve had worse. \u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head, unsh eathing one of his daggers and walking forward. \u201cThe enemy doesn\u2019 t give a shit if you\u2019re wounded.",
  "They\u2019ll use it to their advantage. If you don\u2019 t know how to fight in pain, then you\u2019ll get us both killed.\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d I shift my body weight in annoyance. Little does he know , I\u2019m almost always in pain. It\u2019s pretty much my comfort zone. \u201cThat\u2019 s actually a good point, so I\u2019ll let you have it.\u201d\u201cThank you for being so gracious.\u201d He smirks, and I ignore the immediate surge of warmth low in my belly . He flips his palm upward, showing me the dagger with an oddly short blade. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t necessarily your fighting style. You\u2019re fast, and you\u2019ve become pretty damned formida ble since August. The problem is you\u2019re using daggers that are too easy to pluck out of your hands. You need weaponry designed for your body type.\u201d At least he didn\u2019 t say weaknesses. I study the blade in his hand . It\u2019s beautiful, with a solid black hilt engraved with Tyrrish knots, old, mythical runes of intricate swirls and ties. The blade itself is clearly honed to lethal perfection. \u201cIt\u2019 s spectacular .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d My head snaps up, but there\u2019 s no lie in his onyx eyes. \u201cI had it made for you.\u201d His lips curve slightly . \u201cWhat?\u201d My mouth opens, and my chest tightens.",
  "He took the time to have it made? Shit. That gives me feelings I really don\u2019t want to have. Soft, confusing feelings. \u201cYou heard me. T ake it.\u201d Swallowing the illogical lump in my throat, I take the blade from him. It feels solid in my palm but is infinitely lighter than my other daggers. There\u2019 s no strain on my wrist, and my fingers comfortably wrap around the hilt, making it much more secure than the knives I\u2019ve left on the floor . \u201cWho made it?\u201d \u201cI know someone.\u201d \u201cIn the quadrant?\u201d My eyebrows shoot up. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how resourceful you get after three years here.\u201d A smirk tugs at the corner of his mouth, and I openly stare before remembering where we are. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d I shake my head and hand it back to him. \u201cBut you know I can\u2019t take it.",
  "The only weapons we\u2019re allowed to have are the oneswe earn.\u201d Only challenges or weapons qualifications are acceptable. There\u2019 s a crossbow I have my eye on that I\u2019m not quite expert at yet. \u201cExactly .\u201d He smiles for a flash of a second before moving with a speed I\u2019ve never dream ed possible. He\u2019s even faster than Imogen as he sweeps my feet from under me with one strike, taking me to the mat in a single move. The ease with which he has me on my back is simultaneously appalling and\u2026ridiculously hot, especially with the weight of his hips settled between my thighs. It takes all my willpower not to reach up and brush the stray lock of hair from his forehead.",
  "It was a mistake. Well, if that memory doesn\u2019 t cool me right of f. \u201cAnd what point are you making with this little move?\u201d I ask, well aware that he\u2019 s done it all without knocking the wind out of me. \u201cThere are a dozen of these daggers strapped to my body , so start disarming me.\u201d He lifts a sardonic brow . \u201cUnless you don\u2019t know how to handle an opponent on top of you, and if so, that\u2019 s a whole other issue.\u201d \u201cI know how to handle you on top of me,\u201d I challenge quietly . He lowers his mouth to my ear . \u201cYou won\u2019 t like what happens if you push me.\u201d \u201cOr maybe I will.\u201d I turn just enough that my lips brush the shell of his ear. He jerks up, and the heat in his gaze makes me all too aware of everywhere our bodies connect. \u201cDisarm me before I test that theory in front of everyone in this gym.\u201d \u201cInteresting. I didn\u2019 t take you for an exhibitionist.\u201d \u201cKeep pushing, and I guess you\u2019ll find out.\u201d His gaze drops to my mouth. \u201cI thought you said kissing me was a mistake.\u201d I don\u2019t care if the entire quadrant is watching if that means he\u2019ll kiss me again. \u201cIt was.\u201d He smirks.",
  "\u201cI\u2019m just teaching you that blades aren\u2019 t the only way to disarm an opponent. T ell me, V iolence, are you disarmed?\u201d Arrogant ass.I scoff and start plucking knives from their sheaths, flinging them across the mat while he watches with impatient amusement. Then I lock my legs around his hips and force a roll to the left, putting Xaden on his back. Willingly , of course\u2014there\u2019 s no way I\u2019m kneeling on top of him if he doesn\u2019 t want it that way\u2014but I throw a forearm against his collarbone with the pretense of pinning him anyway and proceed to steal the other daggers he has sheathed along his side. \u201cAnd lastly,\u201d I say with a smile, leaning forward, our heated bodies nearly flush as I snatch the dagger right out of his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d The final blade secure, Xaden throws his palms to the mat and shoves with unnatural strength, arching us straight back until my spine kisses the mat again. \u201cThat\u2019 s.\u201d I suck in a breath, the move shocking me to my toes and lodging him firmly between my thighs. It takes everything I have not to arch up against him and see if he really thinks that kiss was a mistake. \u201cNot fair to use your powers on the mat.\u201d Magical. Sexual.",
  "Whatever . It\u2019s all unfair . \u201cThat\u2019 s the other thing.\u201d He jumps to his feet and offers his hand. I take it, my head rushing as I stand. Not now. Do not get dizzy now. \u201cEmetterio doesn\u2019 t allow powers in order to level the playing field when it comes to challenges. But out there? The field is anything but level, and you need to learn to use whatever you\u2019ve got.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t do much beside ground, shield, and move a piece of parchment.\u201d I sheathe the new dagger , then collect the others and do the same. They really are lovely , all marked with different runes. It\u2019s a shame there are so many parts of Tyrrish culture that were lost centuries ago during the unification, including most runes. I don\u2019 t even know what they all mean.",
  "\u201cWell, looks like we\u2019re going to have to work on that, too.\u201d He sighs and takes up a fighting stance. \u201cNow , earn your nickname and try your best to kill me.\u201d\u2026 February flies by in a blur of exhaustion. Xaden takes every unscheduled moment of my day, and Dain\u2019 s gritted his teeth more than once when the wingleader has pulled me out of squad training because he has something infinitely more important for me to do. Which usually ends with me getting my ass handed to me repeatedly on the mat. But I have to say, he doesn\u2019 t baby me like Dain, and he doesn\u2019 t take it easy on me like Rhiannon does. He pushes me to my physical limit every session but neve r further , usually leaving me a boneless, sweaty heap on the sparring gym floor , gasping for breath. That\u2019 s usually when Imogen reminds me that I\u2019m needed in the weight room. I hate them both. Kind of. It\u2019s hard to argue with the results when I\u2019m learning to take down the strongest fighter in the quadrant. I have yet to beat him, but I\u2019m all right with that. It means he doesn\u2019 t let me win. He also doesn\u2019 t kiss me again, even when I push .",
  "March arrives with uncountable feet of snow that have to be shoveled before morning formation every day. And the moments the relic burns in my back and I feel like I might crawl out of my own skin if the power building within me doesn\u2019 t release reminds me that I still don\u2019t have a signet. It\u2019 s already almost been three months.",
  "Every morning I wake up wondering if today is the day I\u2019ll spontaneously combust. \u201cSharla Gunter ,\u201d Captain Fitzgibbons reads from the death roll, his gloved hands slipping on the frozen parchment. It\u2019s warmer this week, but not by much. \u201cAnd Mushin V edie. W e commend their souls to Malek.\u201d \u201cVedie?\u201d I ask Rhiannon, my eyebrows shooting up as formatio n ends. Ididn\u2019 t know him well, since he was in Second Wing, but the name is still a shock, considering he was rumored to be one of the best among us. \u201cYou didn\u2019 t hear?\u201d She pulls her fur-lined cloak closer around her neck. \u201cHis signet manifested in the middle of Carr\u2019s class yesterday , and he burst into flames.\u201d \u201cHe\u2026burned himself to death?\u201d She nods. \u201cTara said Carr thinks he was supposed to be able to wield fire, but it just overwhelmed him in that first rush and\u2026\u201d \u201cHe went up like a torch,\u201d Ridoc adds. \u201cKind of makes you glad your signet\u2019 s still hiding, huh?\u201d \u201cHiding is one way to put it.\u201d Other than the ability I\u2019m not supposed to even whisper about, I\u2019m proving to be the one thing my mother hates\u2014 average. And it\u2019s not as though I can go to Tairn or Andarna for help.",
  "The signet is all about me, and I\u2019m apparently not delivering, as the stinging relic on my back constantly reminds me. There\u2019 s a tiny, secret part of me that hopes my signet hasn\u2019 t manifested yet because it\u2019s different than the others, not only useful but\u2026meaningful, like Brennan\u2019 s was. \u201cDefinitely makes me want to skip class today ,\u201d Rhiannon mutters, blowing on her hands to keep them warm. \u201cNo skipping class,\u201d Dain admonishes, pinning us with a stare. \u201cWe\u2019re weeks away from the Squad Battle and we need every single one of you at your best to win.\u201d Imogen snorts. \u201cCome on, Aeto s, I think we all know Second Wing has that squad in Tail Section that\u2019s going to smoke the rest of us. Have you ever seen them sprint up the Gauntlet? Pretty sure they\u2019ve been out there even though it\u2019 s still covered in ice.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to win,\u201d Cianna, our executive officer, proclaims with a decisive nod. \u201cSorrengail here might slow us down on the Gauntlet\u201d\u2014she wrinkles her hawkish nose\u2014\u201cand probably in the wielding depa rtment, too, at the rate she\u2019 s advancing\u2014\u201d\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d I fold my arms across my chest. Bet I can shield better than all of them combined.",
  "\u201cBut Rhiannon\u2019 s skills more than make up for that,\u201d Cianna continues. \u201cAnd we all know Liam and Heaton are both going to decimate on the mat for the challenge competition. That only leaves flight maneuvers and whatever task the wingleaders come up with to judge this year .\u201d \u201cOh, is that all? Man, I thought it was going to be hard.\u201d The sarcasm rolling of f Ridoc is thick enough to earn him a glare from Dain. \u201cWe\u2019re down to ten of you,\u201d Dain says, glancing over our group . \u201c Twelve of us in total , which puts us at a slight disadvantage against a couple other squads , but I think we \u2019 ll manage. \u201d We lost two of the new additions last week when the smaller one \u2019 s signet manifested in Battle Brief and they both froze to death in seconds , nearly taking out Rido c with the expo sure , too .",
  "He was treated for frostbite but didn\u2019 t have any permanent damage. Now Nadine and Liam are the only ones left from the batch we acquired after Threshing. \u201cBut in order to manage, I need you guys to get to class.\u201d He lifts his brows at me. \u201cEspecially you. A signet would be great, you know . If you can maybe make that happen.\u201d It\u2019s as if he can\u2019t decide how to treat me lately , as the first-year who\u2019 s struggling but still here or the girl he grew up with. I hate how unsettled everything feels between us, all wrongly sticky , like putting on clothes before you can dry after a bath, but it\u2019s still Dain. At least he\u2019s finally being supportive.",
  "\u201cShe\u2019 s going to miss Carr\u2019s class today ,\u201d Xaden interrupts, appearing behind Sawyer , who hurries to clear a path. \u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d I shake my head and ignore the quick jump of my pulse at the sight of him. \u201cShe needs to go,\u201d Dain argues, then grits his teeth. \u201cI mean, unless the wing has more pressing matters for Cadet Sorrengail, her time is best spentdeveloping her wielding skills.\u201d \u201cI think we both know she\u2019s not going to manifest a signet in that room. She would have already if that was the key.\u201d I wouldn\u2019 t wish the look Xaden levels Dain with on my worst enemy . It\u2019s not anger or even indignation. No, he looks\u2026annoyed, as if Dain\u2019 s complaints are entirely beneath him, which, according to our chain of command, they are. \u201cAnd yes, the wing has more pressing matters for her .\u201d \u201cSir, I\u2019m just not comfortable with her going a day without at least practicing her wielding, and as her squad leader\u2014\u201d He doesn\u2019t know that Xaden\u2019 s been giving me extra wielding sessions while we spar . \u201cFor Dunne\u2019s sake.\u201d Xaden sighs, invoking the goddess of war.",
  "He reaches into the pocket of his cloak and takes out a pocket watch, holding it in his outstretched palm. \u201cPick it up, Sorrengail.\u201d I glance at the two men and wish they\u2019d just sort their shit out between themselves, but there\u2019 s about a zero percent chance of that happening. For the sake of expediency , I throw my mental feet into the floor of the Archives. White-hot power flows around me, raising goose bumps on my arms and lifting the hair at the back of my neck. Raising my right hand, I envision that power twining between my fingers, and little shocks blossom along my skin as I give form to the energy, making it a hand of its own as I ask it to stretch the few feet that separate me from Xaden. There\u2019 s an abrupt halt, as though my tendrils of raw magic hit a wall, but then it gives, and I push forward , keeping tight control of the blazing hand. There\u2019 s a crackle in my head, like the dying embers of a fire, as my power brushes Xaden\u2019 s hand, but I close my mental fist around the pocket watch and then pull. It\u2019s fucking heavy . \u201cYou got this,\u201d Rhiannon ur ges.\u201cLet her concentrate,\u201d Sawyer chides.",
  "The watch plummets for the ground, but I snap my hand back, yanking on my power as though it\u2019s a rope, and the watch flies toward me. I catch it with my left hand before it can smack me in the face.",
  "Rhiannon and Ridoc clap. Xaden walks forward and pluck s the watch from my fingers, dropping it into his cloak. \u201cSee? She\u2019s practiced. Now , we have things to do.\u201d He puts his hand on the small of my back and leads me out of the crowd. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I loathe the way my body demands I lean back into his touch, but I miss it the second it\u2019 s gone. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not wearing flight leathers under that cloak.\u201d He opens the door to the dormitory for me, and I walk inside. The motion is so easy that I know it\u2019s not only practiced but second nature, which is at complete odds with, well\u2026everything I\u2019ve come to know about him. I pause, looking at him like we\u2019re meeting for the first time. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, closing the door behind us and shutting out the blustering cold. \u201cYou opened the door for me.\u201d \u201cOld habits die hard.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cMy father taught me that\u2014\u201d His voice dies abruptly , and his gaze falls away , every muscle in his body locking as though he\u2019 s preparing for an attack. My heart aches at the look that crosses his face, recognizing it well.",
  "Grief. \u201cDon\u2019 t you think it\u2019s a little cold for flying?\u201d I ask, changing the subject in an attempt to help. The pain in his eyes is the kind that never dies, the kind that rises like an unpredic table tide and floods the shorel ine without mercy . He blinks, and it\u2019 s gone. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here.\u201d I nod and hurry to change into the fur-lined leathers we\u2019re issued for winter flight. He has that unreadable mask on when I return, and I knowthere won\u2019 t be any more doors held on my account today . We walk out across the emptying courtyard as cadets scurry off to classes.",
  "\u201cY ou didn\u2019 t answer me.\u201d \u201cAbout what?\u201d He keeps his eyes on the gate to the flight field path and I have to damn near scurry to keep up with his strides. \u201cAbout it being cold for flight.\u201d \u201cThird-years have flight field this afternoon. Kaori and the other professors are just taking it easy on you guys, since the Squad Battle is coming up and they know you need the practice in wielding.\u201d He pushes open the gate, and I hurry after him. \u201cBut I don\u2019 t need the practice?\u201d My voice echoes in the tunnel. \u201cWinning the Squad Battle is nothing in the scheme of keeping you alive. You\u2019ll be on the front lines before the rest of them come next year.\u201d The mage lights play off the harsh angles of his face, casting sinister shadows as we pass each one. \u201cIs that what\u2019 s going to happen next year?\u201d I ask as we come out the other side, the snow whiting out my vision momentarily . It\u2019s piled high on each side of the path, the result of this heavy winter . \u201cI\u2019m going to the front lines?\u201d \u201cInevitably . There\u2019s no telling how long Sgaeyl and Tairn will tolerate being separated. My best guess is that we\u2019ll both have to sacri fice to keep them happy .\u201d He\u2019s clearly not so happy about it himself, but I can\u2019t blame him.",
  "After three years in the quadrant, I\u2019d want to get the hell out, too. My stomach sinks as I realize I\u2019ll be in his shoes when I graduate as well, with no real control on how our dragons\u2019 bond dictates my future posts. I nod, not knowing what else to say, and we walk to the Gauntlet in companionable silence. \u201cSecond Wing,\u201d I note, watching the squad from Tail Section slip and slide their way across the Gauntlet. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want your own squads out here practicing?\u201dA corner of his mouth lifts, and that inhuman facade of his crack s. \u201cWhen I was a first-year , I thought winning was the pinnacle, too. But once you\u2019re in your third year, and you see the things that we do\u2026\u201d His jaw flexes. \u201cLet\u2019 s just say that the games are a lot more lethal.\u201d We head toward the staircase that leads to the flight field, but there\u2019 s already a group coming down, so I move back to let them descend first. My heart launch es into my throat as they come closer , and I snap my frame to an atten tion stance, my spine stiffening.",
  "It\u2019s Commandant Panchek and Colonel Aetos. Reaching the ground first, Dain\u2019 s dad offers me a smile. \u201cAt ease. You\u2019re looking well, Violet. Nice flight lines,\u201d he says, gesturing to the ones on his own cheekbones that come from flight goggles. \u201cYou must be getting a lot of airtime.\u201d \u201cThank you, sir, I am.\u201d I relax my posture and can\u2019t help but return the favor , but my lips are tight. \u201cDain is doing well, too. He\u2019s my squad leader this year .\u201d \u201cHe\u2019 s told me.\u201d He grins, his brown eyes just as warm as Dain\u2019 s. \u201cMira asked about you while we were touring the Southern Wing last month.",
  "Don\u2019 t worry , you\u2019ll get your letter privileges in second year, and then you can keep in touch more often. I\u2019m sure you miss her .\u201d \u201cEvery day.\u201d I nod, pushing past the swell of emotion the admission brings. It\u2019s so much easier to pretend there\u2019 s nothing outside the walls than to wallow in how much I miss my sister . Xaden stif fens at my side as Mom steps out of the stairwell. Oh shit. \u201cMom,\u201d I blurt, and her head turns, her eyes meeting mine. It\u2019 s been more than five months since I\u2019ve seen her, and even though I want to be as composed as she is, as compartmentalized, I just can\u2019 t. I\u2019m not built like she is, like Mira is. I\u2019m my father \u2019s daughter . Her assessing gaze sweeps over me with all the familiarity of a commanding general and a Basgiath cadet, and there\u2019 s no warmth in herexpression as she finishes her perusal.",
  "\u201cI hear you\u2019re having trouble wielding.\u201d I blink and step backward, as though physical distance is going to shelter me from the icy rebuke. \u201cI have the best shields in my year.\u201d For the first time, I\u2019m actually glad I haven\u2019 t manifested a signet, haven\u2019 t given her something to brag about. \u201cWith a dragon like Tairn, I would certainly hope so.\u201d She cocks an eyebrow . \u201cIf not, all of that incredible, enviable power will have been\u2026\u201d Her sigh is a puf f of steam in the air . \u201cSquandered.\u201d I try my best to swallow the growing knot in my throat. \u201cY es, General.\u201d \u201cYou have been the topic of some conversation, though.\u201d Her gaze skims the top of my head, and I know she\u2019s looking at the silver -tipped braid she thinks marks me as cursed, the hair she told me I was better of f cutting. \u201cOh?\u201d She actually talks about me? \u201cWe\u2019re all wondering what powers\u2014if any\u2014you\u2019re wielding from the golden dragon?\u201d Her lips form a smile I\u2019m sure she thinks is soft, but I know her too well to fall for it. \u201cNo.\u201d The single word from Tairn rumbles through my entire body . \u201cDo not speak of it.\u201d \u201cNothing yet.\u201d I drag my tongue over my chapped lower lip.

  "\u201cToo bad.\u201d Mom forces another smile. \u201cGlad to see you\u2019re alive, Cadet Sorrengail.\u201d Her gaze flashes sideways and instantly hardens to steel. \u201cEven if the company you\u2019re forced to keep is more than questionable.\u201d Shit. Shit. Shit. I can\u2019t step in front of Xaden and make him look weak. I can\u2019t even glance his way without telling my mother where my allegi ance lies\u2026 without telling myself. \u201cI alway s felt that we resolved any of those questions years ago,\u201d Xaden says, his voice low , but he\u2019 s gone taut as a bowstring next to me. \u201cHmm.\u201d Mom turns toward the citadel in clear dismissal. \u201cDo see if you can master some kind of signet, Cadet Sorrengail. You have a legacy to live up to. \u201d \u201c Yes , General. \u201d The informal words cost more than I \u2019 m prepared to admit , ripping into the confidence it \u2019 s taken me nearly eight months to build with talon-sharp precision. \u201c Good to see you , Violet.",
  "\u201d Dain \u2019 s dad offers me a sympathetic smile , and Panchek",
  "outright ignores us , running to catch up with Mom . I don\u2019t say a word to Xaden before I climb the stairs, each step making me only angrier until I\u2019m a ball of rage by the time I reach the top of the cliffside. \u201cYou didn\u2019 t tell her about how you got out of the attack in your bedroom,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a statement, not a question. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about me showing up.\u201d I know exactly what he\u2019 s talking about. \u201cI don\u2019 t ever see her . And you told me not to tell anyone.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019 t realize it was quite like that between you,\u201d Xaden says, his tone surprisingly soft as we start down the box canyon toward the flight field. \u201cOh, that\u2019s nothing,\u201d I toss out, intentionally making my tone as flippant as possible. \u201cShe spent almost an entire year ignoring me when Dad died.\u201d A self-deprecat ing laugh slips past my lips. \u201cWhich was almost as wholesome as the years she spent barely tolerating my existence because I wasn\u2019 t perfect like Brennan or a warrior like Mira.\u201d I shouldn\u2019 t be saying these things. These are the thoughts families keep behind their doors so they can wear their polished, perfect reputations like armor when in public.",
  "\u201cShe doesn\u2019 t know you very well, then,\u201d Xaden remarks, keeping pace with my furious strides. I scoff. \u201cOr she sees right through me. Problem is, I\u2019m never quite sure which it is. I\u2019m too busy trying to live up to whatever impossible standard she sets to ask myself if they\u2019r e even standards I give a shit about.\u201d My narrowed gaze swings to him. \u201cAnd what was that about anyway?",
  "Saying that you resolved questions years ago?\u201d \u201cJust reminding her that I paid the price for my loyalty .\u201d His brow furrows, but he stares ahead of us. \u201cPaid what price?\u201d The question slips out before I can stop my foolish tongue. I can\u2019t help but remember what Dain said, that Xaden has reasonsto never for give my mother . \u201cBoundaries, Violence.\u201d His head lowers for the span of a heartbeat, and when it rises, he\u2019s wearing that polished give-no-fucks mask he\u2019s so good at donning. Lucky for us, the strain of the moment is broken as Tairn and Sgaeyl land across the field ahead, accompa nied by a shiny smaller dragon who makes me instantly smile. \u201cWe\u2019re all flying today?\u201d I ask, following as he walks toward the trio. \u201cWe\u2019re all learni ng today . You need to learn how to stay on, and I need to learn why the hell it\u2019s so hard for you,\u201d he answers. \u201cAndar na needs to learn how to keep up. Tairn needs to learn how to share his space in a tighter flight formation, and every other dragon but Sgaeyl is too scared to fly closer .\u201d Tairn chuf fs in agreement as we approach. \u201cAnd what is Sgaeyl learning?\u201d I ask, eyeing the giant blue dragon. Xaden grins.",
  "\u201cShe\u2019 s been leading for almost three years now. She\u2019s going to have to learn how to follow . Or at least practice.\u201d Tairn\u2019s chuff sounds suspiciously like a laugh, and she snaps at him, baring her teeth and coming within inches of his neck. \u201cDragon relationships are absolutely incomprehensible,\u201d I murmur .",
  "\u201cYeah? You should try a human one sometime. Just as vicious, but less fire.\u201d He mounts with an ease I envy . \u201cNow let\u2019 s go.\u201dThe Squad Battle is mor e important than the wingleaders will let on. They like to joke that it\u2019 s a game, that it\u2019 s just bragging rights for the squad leaders and the winning squad, but it\u2019 s not. They\u2019r e all watching. The commandant, the pr ofessors, the commanding officers\u2014they\u2019r e watching to see who will rise to the top. They\u2019r e salivating to see who will fall. \u2014PAGE SEVENTY -SEVEN , THE BOOK OF BRENNAN CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE \u201c Tap out ! \u201d Rhiannon screams as a rider out of Second Wing fights to drag himself forward on the mat , his hands splayed wide , his fingernails digging in as Liam holds him in a leg lock , forcing his back into what should be an impossible arch .",
  "My heart pounds as the excitement of today\u2019 s matches reaches a fever pitch. It\u2019s the last challenge of this portion of the Squad Battle, and the crowd pushes at our backs, forcing me to continuously struggle not to fall over onto the mat. After two events, we\u2019re in seventh out of twenty-four on the leaderboard, but if Liam wins, we\u2019ll jump to third. My flight time in the gauntlet sky race was the slowest in squad, but that\u2019s because I kept forcing Tairn to release his magical hold on me\u2014and then we\u2019d lose precious seconds while he had to dip to catch me and toss me back in the saddle.",
  "Over and over and over again. I swear , the bruises on my ass from landing in the hard divot hurt less than Tairn\u2019s scoff that I\u2019d humiliated his entire family line as we crossed the finish line last. Mikael cries out in pain, the sound sharp, near earsplitting, and pullingmy atten tion back to the action in front of me. Liam holds fast and presses his advantage. \u201cFuck me, that looks like it hurts,\u201d I mutter over the cheering first-years. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s not walking for a while,\u201d Ridoc agrees, cringing as the arc of Mikael\u2019 s back looks like a broken spine waiting to happen. With another cry, Mikael slams his palm into the mat three times, and the crowd roars. \u201cYes! Go, Liam!\u201d Sawyer screams from behind me, and Liam drops Mikael to the mat, where he sprawls out, exhausted. \u201cWe won!\u201d Liam rushes for us, and I\u2019m swept up into a tangl e of arms and shouting and joyous squadmates. I\u2019m pretty sure I even see Imogen in this little melee. But I don\u2019 t see Dain. Where the hell is Dain?",
  "He would never miss this. \u201cYour winner!\u201d Professor Emett erio shouts, his voice ringing through the gym and quieting the zealous energy as Liam steps out of our crushing hug. \u201cLiam Mairi from Second Squad, Flame Section, Fourth W ing!\u201d Liam puts up both hands in victory and turns in a small circle, and the sound of cheering makes my ears ring in the best way . Commandant Panchek steps onto the mat, and Liam joins the rest of our squad, sweat pouring off his skin. \u201cI know you were all expecting the last portion of the Squad Battle to happen tomorrow , but the cadre and I have a surprise.\u201d He has every single rider \u2019s attention now . \u201cInstead of telling you what the final, unknown task will be and giving you tonight to plan for it, your final task will begin this hour! \u201d He grins, throwing out his hands and turning just like Liam had. \u201cTonight?\u201d Ridoc whispers. My stomach hits the ground.",
  "\u201cDain isn\u2019 t here. Neither is Cianna.\u201d \u201cOh shit,\u201d Imogen whispers, looking over the crowd herself. \u201cAs you may have noticed, your squad leaders and their executiveofficers have been\u2026shall we say, sequestered with your section leaders and wingleaders, and no, before someone asks, your task is not to find them.\u201d He continues to walk in a small circle, addressing each side of the mat. \u201cYou are to break into your squads and accomplish a unique mission this evening without the leadership and instruction of your squad leaders.\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019 t that defeat the purpose of having squad leaders?\u201d someone asks across the mat. \u201cThe purpose of a squad leader is to form a tightly knit unit that can carry on with a mission after their demise. Consider your leaders\u2026 demised.\u201d Panchek shrugs with a gleeful smile. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own, riders.",
  "Your mission is simple: find and acquire, by any means necessary , the one thing that would be most advantageous to our enemies regarding the war effort. Leadership will serve as unbiased judges, and the winning squad will be awarded sixty points.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s enough to put us into first!\u201d Rhiannon whispers, linking her arm with mine. \u201cW e could win the glory of going to the front!\u201d \u201cWhat are the boundaries?\u201d someone to the right asks. \u201cAnything within the walls of Basgiath,\u201d Panchek answers. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare let me see you trying to haul a dragon back here. They\u2019ll incinerate you out of sheer annoyance.\u201d The squad to our left mutters their disappointment. \u201cYou have\u201d\u2014Panchek pulls out his pocket watch\u2014\u201cthree hours , at which time we\u2019ll expe ct you to presen t your stolen treasures in the Battle Brief room.\u201d We all stare at him in silence. Out of everything I imagined the third and final task to be\u2026well, this wasn\u2019 t anywhere near that list. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Panchek shoos his hands at us. \u201cGo!\u201d Pandemonium ensues. This is what happens when you remove our leadership.",
  "We\u2019re\u2026a hot freaking mess.\u201cSecond Squad!\u201d Imogen yells, putting her hands up. \u201cFollow me!\u201d Sawyer and Heaton make sure we\u2019re all ducklings, following in Imogen\u2019 s wake as she leads us across the gym to the weight room. \u201cYou did great,\u201d I tell Liam as he walks at my side, still struggling to catch his breath. \u201cIt was epic.\u201d Ridoc hands Liam a waterskin, which Liam promptly drains. \u201cLet\u2019 s go, let\u2019s go,\u201d Imogen says, ushering us through the open door. She does a quick head count and then closes the door , wielding to lock it. I find a seat on one of the benches, flanked by Rhiannon and Liam. \u201cFirst thing.",
  "Who wants to be in command?\u201d Imogen asks, looking at the ten of us. Ridoc throws his hand in the air . Rhiannon turns and forces it back down. \u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll turn this into some kind of prank.\u201d \u201cFair point.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cLiam?\u201d Quinn asks, lifting her eyebrows. \u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head, but his gaze darts in my direction, giving his reasoning away . \u201cNo one is going to try and of f me while we\u2019re out tonight,\u201d I ar gue. He turns back toward Imogen and shakes his head one more time. Of course she nods.",
  "They\u2019re both on T eam Xaden. \u201cYou keep command,\u201d Rhiannon suggests, looking at Imogen. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten us this far .\u201d A murmur of agreement goes around the room. \u201cEmery? Heaton?\u201d Imogen asks. \u201cAs third-years, it\u2019 s your right.\u201d \u201cNo thanks.\u201d Heaton leans back against the wall. \u201cNope. There\u2019 s a reason neither of us wanted to be in leadership ,\u201d Emery adds, sitting next to Nadine. \u201cAny reason you wouldn\u2019 t be all right following Imogen\u2019 s command for a few hours, Nadine?\u201dEvery one of us turns to face the first-year who hasn\u2019 t been remotely subtle about her hatred of marked ones. Knowing now that she\u2019s from a northern village on the border of the provinces of Deaconshire and Tyrrendor , I can see her reasonin g. I just don\u2019t agree with it, hence why I\u2019m not exactly friendly with her . She visibly swallows, her nervous gaze skittering over all of us. \u201cI\u2019m fine with it.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d Imoge n folds her arms across her chest, the wrist with her rebellion relic peeking out from under her tunic.",
  "\u201cWe have a little less than three hours. What are your ideas?\u201d \u201cWhat about a piece of weaponr y?\u201d Ridoc suggests. \u201cA cross-bolt would be deadly to any of our dragons in the hands of our enemies.\u201d \u201cToo big,\u201d Quinn says decisivel y. \u201cThere\u2019 s only one in the museum, and honestly , it\u2019s not even the bolt that\u2019 s deadly , it\u2019s the launching system.\u201d \u201cNext?\u201d Imogen glances at each of us. \u201cWe could steal Panchek\u2019 s underw\u2014\u201d Ridoc starts before Rhiannon slams her hand over his mouth. \u201cAnd that\u2019 s why we don\u2019 t let you lead.\u201d She arches a brow at him. \u201cCome on, guys! Think! What\u2019 s the most useful thing to our enemy?\u201d Imogen\u2019 s brow puckers over her pale green eyes. \u201cInformation,\u201d Liam answers. He swings his gaze toward me. \u201cViolet, what about stealing the news missives from the Archives? The ones that come in from the front?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s after seven. The Archives are locked, and it\u2019s the kind of vault that even wielding isn\u2019t going to touch. The whole room is sealed up airtight in case of fire.\u201d \u201cDamn.\u201d Imogen sighs.",
  "\u201cThat was a good one.\u201d The entire room breaks into conversation, each voice louder than the next as suggestions are hurled into the open. Information. My stomach twists as an idea takes form.",
  "It would be ashowstopper , something no one else could compare to. But\u2026 I shake my head. It\u2019 s too risky . \u201cWhat are you thinking, Sorrengail?\u201d Imogen asks and the room falls silent. \u201cI can see the little gears turning in your mind.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing.\u201d I glance at the members of our squad. But is it nothing? \u201cGet up here and work it out in your head,\u201d Imogen orders. \u201cSeriously , it\u2019s mad. Like, undoable. We\u2019d get thrown in the brig if we\u2019re caught.\u201d I snap my mouth shut before I say anything more. But it\u2019 s too late\u2014Imogen\u2019 s eyes are sparkling with interest. \u201cGet. Up. Here. And. Work. It. Out,\u201d she orders, making sure I know it\u2019s not a suggestion. \u201cWe can wield, right?\u201d I stand, brushing my hands down my sides and the hilts of the six daggers sheathed there. \u201cBy all means necessary ,\u201d Heaton repeats, nodding. \u201cAll right.\u201d I rock back on my heels, letting my mind whirl through a plan. \u201cI know Ridoc can wield ice, Rhiannon can retrieve, Sawyer can manipulate metal, Imogen can mind-wipe recent memories\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m fast,\u201d she adds.",
  "Something she has in common with Xaden. \u201cHeaton, what about you?\u201d I ask. \u201cI can breathe underwater ,\u201d they answer . I blink. \u201cAwesome, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to come in handy if we do this. Emery?\u201d \u201cI can control wind.\u201d He grins. \u201cA lot of wind.\u201d All right, that one could be defensively useful, but not quite what I\u2019m looking for .",
  "My boots squeak on the floor as I turn to face her . \u201cQuinn?\u201d \u201cI can astral project. Keep my body in one place and then walk around somewhere else.\u201dMy mouth hangs open, matching about half the squad. \u201cI know , it\u2019s pretty awesome.\u201d She winks, pulling her curls up into a bun. \u201cYes. That we can use.\u201d My head bobs as I parcel through the easiest way to do this. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Sorren gail?\u201d Imogen prompts, tucking the short hair on one side of her shaved head behind her ear . \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me I\u2019ve lost my mind, but if we pull it off, we\u2019ll win for sure. \u201d I might not be enough like my mother to win her approval, but I know where she keeps the most valuable information. \u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to break into my mother \u2019s office.\u201d \u2026 \u201cYou are so fucking creepy .\u201d Ridoc squirms two hours later, leaning away from Quinn, well, from Quinn \u2019s astral form. Her body is currently with Heaton, guarded in the weight room. The rest of us are sneaking through the hallways past the Healer Quadrant. We\u2019ve already run into a squad from Second and another from Third, but none of us had time to question or deter the others.",
  "We\u2019ll rise or fall on our own merit with this timeline, and we\u2019v e wasted the last two hours waiting for night to fall so it would even be possible. \u201cI\u2019ve never been farther than this,\u201d Emery says as we pass the last door to the clinic. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even been to the Archives?\u201d Imogen asks. \u201cI avoid that duty like the plague,\u201d Emery answers. \u201cScribes freak me out. Quiet little know-it-alls, acting like they can make or break someone by writing something down.\u201d I grin. There\u2019 s more truth to that statement than most people realize. \u201cInfantry is still out camping.\u201d Rhiannon points out the windo ws to the dozens of campfires illuminating the field below .\u201cMust be nice to get a break,\u201d Nadine remarks, but there\u2019 s no snotty tone I\u2019ve come to expect, just the same exhaustion I think we all feel. \u201cScribes will all go home for the summer . Healers get to spend their weekends on those mind-body-health retreats, and the infantry might have to practice making and breaking camp in the snow through winter , but at least they spend those months around a campfire.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll get to go home,\u201d Imogen ar gues. \u201cAfter graduation,\u201d Rhiannon retorts.",
  "\u201cFor what? A couple of days?\u201d We come to a fork in the path, where we can follow the tunnel down to the Archives or climb into the fortress of the war college. \u201cThere\u2019 s no turning back from here,\u201d I say to the group, looki ng up the spiral staircase I\u2019ve climbed so many times that I know each step by heart. \u201cLead on!\u201d Quinn orders, and we all jump about a foot in the air . \u201cShhh!\u201d Imogen hisses. \u201cSome of us can get caught, you know .\u201d \u201cRight. Sorry .\u201d Quinn cringes. \u201cEveryone, remember the plan,\u201d I whisper . \u201cNo one deviates. No one .\u201d They all nod, and we begin our silent climb up the dark stairs, then cling to the shadows as we cross the stone courtyard of Basgiath. \u201cSur e could use Xaden right about now .\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d Andarna assures me in the happiest of tones. I swear , nothing bothers her. She\u2019s the most fearless kid I\u2019ve ever met, and I grew up with Mira.",
  "\u201cIt\u2019s six flights straight up,\u201d I whisper when we reach the next set of stairs, and we continue to climb as fast as we can without making any noise. Anxiety spikes, and my power rises in response, the relic in my back heating to an uncomfortable burn. It\u2019s always there lately , simmering beneath my skin, reminding me that performing lesser magics isn\u2019t going to be enough to vent it if I don\u2019 t manifest a signet soon. Eventually , we reach the top of the steps, and Liam leans out just far enough to see down the length of what\u2019 s always felt like the world\u2019s longesthallway . \u201cThere are mage lights in sconces,\u201d he whispers. \u201cAnd you were right.\u201d He withdraws into the safety of the stairwell. \u201cThere \u2019s only one guard stationed at the door .\u201d \u201cWas there any light under the door?\u201d I ask quietly . My heart sounds like it\u2019s loud enough for the whole college to hear, even the infantry cadets sleeping hundreds of feet below us. \u201cNo.\u201d He turns to Quinn. \u201cThe guard looks about six feet tall, but he seems pretty athletic. The other stairwell is down the hallway to the left, which means you\u2019ll have to get his attention and then book it.\u201d Quinn nods. \u201cNo problem.\u201d \u201cEveryone else know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d I ask. There are eight nods.",
  "\u201cThen let\u2019s do this. Quinn, you\u2019re up. Everyone else, circle back down so he can\u2019t see us if he looks this way.\u201d I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re actually about to do this. If she catches us, there won\u2019 t be any mercy .",
  "It\u2019s not in her nature. We retreat, and Quinn charges up the stairs. Her voice is muffled by the stone walls, but we hear the guard\u2019 s pounding footsteps clear as day as he charges past the stairway . \u201cGet back here! Y ou can\u2019 t be here!\u201d \u201cNow!\u201d Imogen orders. We launch, leaving Rhiannon and Emery in the stairwell as we fly into the hallw ay. Sawyer rushes toward the opposite staircase, throwing the door shut and twisting the metal joints with his powers as we bolt down the hall. I\u2019ve never run this fast in my life, and Nadine is already at the door, trying to unweave whatever wards my mother has used. Liam steps into the spot where the guard stood and lifts his chin in the air, taking the same posture. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d \u201cYep,\u201d I answer , my chest heav ing as Imogen steps in to help Nadine. Nadine\u2019 s signet is the ability to unweave wards, which I never thought would come in this handy . Riders are always out there building the wards,keeping the shields up around Navarre. Then again, not many riders try to break into the commanding general\u2019s office.",
  "\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be fine in there,\u201d I assure him, a smile tugging at my lips. \u201cWhich is funny , since I didn\u2019 t think the same way the last time I was standing here.\u201d \u201cGot it!\u201d Nadine whispers, nudging the door open. \u201cIf you hear me whistle\u2014\u201d Liam starts, worry lining his forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ll go out the window or something,\u201d I assure him as Ridoc and Sawyer rush past. \u201cRelax.\u201d Leaving Liam to stand watch, I join the others in Mom\u2019 s office. \u201cDon\u2019 t touch the mage lights or she\u2019ll know ,\u201d I warn them. \u201cYou have to make your own.\u201d I flick my wrist, twisting my power into a bright blue flame and letting it drift over me. It\u2019 s one of the things I\u2019m actually good at. \u201cHow nice is this?\u201d Ridoc flops down onto the red couch.",
  "\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for you to be\u2026you,\u201d Sawyer lectures, heading for the bookcase. \u201cHelp me search for something useful.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll take the table.\u201d Imogen and Nadine start sorting through papers on the six-seater conference table. \u201cWhich leaves me and the desk,\u201d I mutter , walking around the intimidating piece of furniture and praying I don\u2019t trigger any wards she\u2019s set. There are three folded missives in the middle, and I pick up the first, revealing a sharp dagger with an alloy-infused hilt and what looks to be a Tyrrish rune in the handle that she must be using as a letter opener or something. I unfold the letter with as much care as I can. General Sorr engail, The raids around Athebyne have spread the wing too thin. Being posted beyond the safety of the wards comes with considerable hazar ds, and though I am loath to request reinfor cements, I must. If we do not reinfor ce the post, we may be forced to abandon it. We are protecting Navarrian citizens with life, limb, and wing , but I cannot adequately relay how dire thesituation is here. I know you receive the dailies from our scribe attachment, but I would be remiss in my duties as executive officer of the Southern Wing if I did not write to you personally .",
  "Please find us r einfor cements. Sincer ely, Major Kallista Neema I breathe past the ache that erupts in my chest at the plea in her letter . We\u2019ve discussed nearly daily attacks in Battle Brief, but nothing on that scale.",
  "Maybe they don\u2019 t want to scar e us. But if it\u2019s that terrifying out there, we have every right to know\u2014we\u2019ll likely be called into service before we graduate. Maybe even this year . \u201cThese are all\u2026numbers,\u201d Imogen says, rifling through the conference table papers. \u201cIt\u2019s April,\u201d I say, reaching for the next missive. \u201cShe\u2019 s working on next year\u2019s budget.\u201d Everyone stops and turns to look at me, all wearing expre ssions of varying degrees of disbelief. \u201cWhat?\u201d I shrug. \u201cDid you think this place ran itself?\u201d \u201cKeep looking,\u201d Imogen orders. I unfold the next missive. General Sorr engail, Protests regarding conscription laws are growing within the province of Tyrrendor . Knowing that due to Tyrrendor \u2019s size, it provides the majority of our conscripts to replenish our front lines, we cannot affor d to lose the support of the people again. Perhaps an influx of defensive spending on outposts here would not only bolster the province\u2019 s economy and remind the Tyrrish how needed they are to the defense of our kingdom, but also easethe unrest. Please consider this solution as an alternative to suppr essing the unrest with for ce. Sincer ely, Lieutenant Colonel Alyssa T ravonte What the hell?",
  "I close the letter and put it back on Mom\u2019 s desk, then turn to the giant map hanging on the wall directly above me. Unrest isn\u2019t new to Tyrrendor , nor is the sentiment against conscription, but we certainly haven\u2019 t heard any political rumblings in Battle Brief. Other than to quell discontent, it would make no sense to increas e defensive spending there, especially since it holds our fewest number of outposts due to the natural barrier provided by the Cliffs of Dralor , which are unscalable by gryphons. Tyrrendor should already be one of the safest provinces on the Continent. Well, except Aretia. Where that capital should be, there is only a scorch mark, as though the burning of the city has singed the map as well. I study the map for precious seconds, noting the battlement markers dotted along the countryside. Logically , there are more outposts along our more active border zones and, according to this map, more troops in those locations. It shows all of Navarre, Krovla to the south, Braevick and Cygnisen to the southeast, and even the barriers of the Barrens, the ruined deserted lands at the southern tip of the Contin ent. It also shows each of our outposts and supply routes within Navarre. A slow grin spreads across my face.",
  "\u201cHey , Second Squad. I know what we need to steal.\u201d It takes a matter of minutes for us to haul the map down and cut it away from its frame, then another to roll it, securing it with leather ties Imogen pulls out of her satchel. Liam whistles, and my heart nearly leaps out of my chest. \u201cShit!\u201d Ridoc races to the door and cracks it open as we all prepare toflee. \u201cWhat\u2019 s going on out there?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019 s pounding at the hall door! It\u2019s going to give any second. We have to go now,\u201d Liam whisper -shouts, holding the door open as we all race into the hallway . The map is too big for one person to carry , and Sawyer and Imogen struggle through the doorway as the guard kicks in the door farther down the hall.",
  "My stom ach hits the floor , and panic threatens to overwhelm logical thought. \u201cAnd we\u2019re fucked,\u201d Nadine announces. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d the guard shouts, charging toward us. \u201cWe\u2019re dead if he catches us with the map.\u201d Ridoc bounces on his toes like he\u2019s preparing to fight. On any given day, I\u2019d argue that riders are the superior fighters\u2014we have to be\u2014but that Basgiath guard might just give us a run for our money . \u201cWe can\u2019 t hurt him,\u201d I protest. The guard barrels past the first stairwell and Rhiannon steps into the middle of the hallway , her arms outstretched.",
  "\u201cPlease work. Please work. Please work,\u201d Imogen chants. The map disappears out of her hands and reappears down the hallway in Rhiannon\u2019 s. I barely have time to register that it worked as the guard stumbl es, but he keeps running. Any closer and he\u2019ll see my face. \u201cThis was not part of the plan.\u201d Liam moves to my side. \u201cAdapt! Emery!\u201d Imogen hisses, and the third-year steps to the front of our little raiding party . \u201cI\u2019m so sorry , man.\u201d He holds out his hands and pushes. A torrent of air rushes down the hallway , rippi ng tapestries from the walls and knocking into the guard, sending him flying against the stone wall. \u201cRun!\u201d We sprin t down the hall toward where the guard lies limp. \u201cPut him inhere,\u201d I hiss, forcing open the next door, the one that belongs to one of my mother \u2019s undersecretaries. Liam and Ridoc haul the guard in, and I put my fingers to his neck. \u201cGood strong pulse.",
  "He just knocked him out. Open his mouth. \u201d I snag the vial hidden in the pocket of my leathers, uncork it, and then let the tonic flow into the guard\u2019 s mouth. \u201cHe\u2019ll sleep the rest of the night.\u201d Liam\u2019 s wide eyes meet mine. \u201cY ou\u2019re kind of terrifying.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d I grin, and we get out of there, running as fast as we can. Fifteen minutes later, our chests are still heaving as we skid into the Battle Brief room, just under the clock. We\u2019re the last to arrive, and the tick of Dain\u2019 s jaw from where he sits in the top row with the other leadership tells me we\u2019re going to get an earful about it. I drag my gaze away , and we find our seats as presentations begin in order of squad, giving us enough time to recover from our sprinting session before we have to take the stage.",
  "A squad in First Wing stole Kaori\u2019 s handwritten manual on the personal habits and flaws of all active dragons. Impressive. A squad in Seco nd Wing elicits an appreciative murmur when they reveal the uniform of one of the Infantry professors, fully intact with something riders never bear\u2014a name tag. That would grant any enemy access to our outposts, given the rank on the shoulder . Third Wing\u2019s best offering is a stunned, wide-eyed scribe, stolen straight from his bed, and given the way his mouth isn\u2019t moving\u2026 Yep, someone\u2019 s signet power takes away speech. The poor thing is going to be traumatized when they finally let him go.",
  "When it\u2019s our turn to take the stage, Sawyer and Liam, the two tallest in our squad, hold the top corners of our map so it\u2019 s visible to all as it unrolls. I stand back next to Imogen and search the leadership for a certain pair of onyx eyes. There he is .Xaden is leaning against the wall near the other wingleaders, watching me with a pulse-quickening mix of curiosity and expectation. \u201cIt was your idea,\u201d Imogen whispers, nudging me forward. \u201cPresent.\u201d Markham\u2019 s eyes flare wide as saucers as he forces himself to stand, followed quickly by Devera, whose mouth hangs so wide, it\u2019s almost comical. I clear my throat and gesture to the map. \u201cWe have brought the ultimate weapon for our enemies. An up-to-date map of all current outposts of Navarrian wings, to include troop strength of infantry battlements.\u201d I point to the forts along the Cygnisen border . \u201cAs well as the locations of all current skirmishes in the last thirty days. Including last night.\u201d A murmur rips through the quadrant. \u201cAnd how do we know this map is, in fact, current?\u201d Kaori asks, holding his reclaimed journal under one arm. There\u2019 s no stopping the smile that spreads across my face.",
  "\u201c Because we stole it from General Sorrengail \u2019 s office. \u201d Absolute mayhe m breaks out , some of the riders rushing the stage as professors battle their way toward us , but I ignore it all as Xaden tilts one corner of that beautiful mouth and tips an imaginary hat to me , bowing his head for a heartbeat before bringing his gaze back to hold mine . Satisfaction fills every ounce of my being as I smile up at him. It doesn\u2019 t matter how the vote comes down. I\u2019ve already won.Ther e is no str onger bond than that between two mated dragons. It goes beyond the depth of human love or adoration to a primal, undeniable r equir ement for pr oximity . One cannot survive without the other .",
  "\u2014C OLONEL KAORI\u2019S FIELD GUIDE TO DRAGONKIND CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Flying for short distances is something I manage. Flight maneuvers\u2014the dips and dives that come with combat formations \u2014send me spinning through the sky unless Tairn holds me on with bands of his own power . But flying for six hours straight for our prize, a weeklong tour of a forward outpost, might just be the death of me. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m dying.\u201d Nadine bends over, bracing her hands on her knees. \u201cI feel that.\u201d Every vertebra in my spine screams as I stretch, and the hands that were freezing only a few minutes ago start to sweat inside my leather gloves. Naturally , Dain is minimally affected, his posture only slightly stiff as he and Professor Devera greet a tall man in rider black, who I assume is the outpost commander . \u201cWelcome, cadets,\u201d the commander says with a professional smile, folding his arms across the chest of his lightweight leathers. His salt-and- pepper hair makes it hard to determine his age, and he has that gaunt, weathered look all riders get when they\u2019ve been stationed on the border for too long.",
  "\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d all like to get settled and into something a littlemore appropriate to the climate. Then we\u2019ll show you around Montserrat.\u201d Rhiannon inhales sharply , her gaze sweeping over the mountains. \u201cYou all right?\u201d She nods. \u201cLater .\u201d Later arrives in exact ly twelve sweat-soaked minutes as we\u2019re shown to our double-occupancy barracks rooms. They\u2019re sparse, only furnished with two beds, two wardrobes, and a single desk under a wide window . She\u2019s quiet the entire time we make our way through the bathing chamber to wash off the ride and alarm ingly silent while we dress in our summer leathers. It may only be April here at Montserrat, but it feels like Basgiath in June. \u201cYou going to tell me what\u2019 s up?\u201d I ask, stowing my pack beneath the bed before making sure all my daggers are where they\u2019re supp osed to be. The hilts are barely visible in the sheaths I wear at my thighs, but I doubt many people this far east would recognize the T yrrish symbols. Rhiannon\u2019 s hands tremble with what looks like nervous energy as she straps her sword to her back.",
  "\u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d I mental ly bring up a map. \u201cWe\u2019re about two hundred miles from the coast\u2014\u201d \u201cMy village is less than an hour away on foot.\u201d Her eyes meet mine in an unspoken plea, so much emotio n swirling in their dark-brown depths that my throat clogs, choking my words. Taking her hand s in mine, I squeeze, nodding. I know exactly what she\u2019s asking and exactly what it will cost if we\u2019re caught. \u201cDon\u2019 t tell anyone,\u201d I whisper , even though it\u2019s just us in the tiny room. \u201cWe have six days to figure it out and we will.\u201d It\u2019s a promise and we both know it. Someone pounds on our door . \u201cLet\u2019 s go, Second Squad!\u201d Dain. Nine months ago, I would have relished this time away with him. Now I find myself avoiding his constant expectations of me\u2014or justavoiding him in general. Funny how much can change in such a short time.",
  "We join the others, and Major Quade gives us the grand tour of the outpost. My stomach growls, but I ignore it, taking in the hectic energy of the base. The fortress is basically four massive walls, filled with barracks and various chambers with turrets on each corner and a large, arched entrance that boasts a spiked portcullis that looks ready to drop at any second. On one end of the courtyard, there\u2019 s a stable with a blacksmith and armory for the company of infantry stationed here, and on the other is the dining hall. \u201cAs you can see,\u201d Major Quade tells us as we stand in the middle of the muddy courtyard, \u201cwe\u2019re built for siege. In the event of attack, we can feed and house everyone within for an adequate amount of time.\u201d Adequate?",
  "Ridoc mouths, lifting his brows. I press my lips together to keep from laughing, and Dain gives him a look that promises retribution from where he stands beside me. My smile falls away . \u201cAs one of the eastern outposts, we have a full twelve riders stationed here. Three are out on patrol now, three wait, standing by in case they\u2019re needed, and the other six are in various stages of rest,\u201d Quade continues. \u201cWhat is that look for?\u201d Dain whispers. \u201cWhat look?\u201d I ask as the distin ct roar of a dragon echoes off the stone walls. \u201cThat should be one of our patrols returning now,\u201d Quade says, smiling like he wants to mean it but can\u2019 t quite find the ener gy. \u201cThe one where someone just sucked the joy out of your world,\u201d Dain responds, bending his head slightly and keeping his voice low enough that only I can hear him. I could lie to him, but that would make our semi-truce even more awkward. \u201cI was just remembering the guy I used to climb trees with, that\u2019s all.\u201dHe startles like I\u2019ve slapped him.",
  "\u201cSo we\u2019ll get you riders fed and put to bed, and then we\u2019ll work on who you\u2019ll be shadowing while you\u2019re here,\u201d Quade continues. \u201cWill we get to participate in any active scenarios?\u201d Heaton asks, practically vibrating with excitement. \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Devera snaps. \u201cIf you see combat, then I\u2019ve failed as this being the safest place on the border to send you,\u201d Quade answers. \u201cBut you get bonus points for enthusiasm. Let me guess. Third-year?\u201d Heaton nods. Quade turns slightly and smiles at three indistinct figures in rider black as they walk under the portcullis. \u201cThere they are now. Why don\u2019t you three come and meet\u2014\u201d \u201cViolet?\u201d My head whips toward the gate, and my heart combusts in a series of erratic beats that leaves me clutc hing my chest with the best kind of shock.",
  "No way. There\u2019 s no way. I stumble for the gate, forgetting to be stoic, to be emotionally untouchable, as she breaks into a run, her arms opening just before we collide. She sweeps me up, yanking me against her chest and squeezing tight. She smells like dirt and dragon and the coppery tang of blood, but I don\u2019t care. I hug her back just as hard. \u201cMira.\u201d I bury my face against her shoulder , and my eyes burn as she rests her hand on top of the very braid she taught me how to do. It\u2019s as if the weight of everything that\u2019s happened over the last nine months comes crashing down, slamming into me with the force of a cross-bolt. The wind of the parapet. The look in Xaden\u2019 s eyes when he realized I was a Sorrengail. The sound of Jack swearing he\u2019d kill me. The smell of burning flesh that first day .The look on Aurelie\u2019 s face when she fell from the Gauntlet. Pryor and Luca and T rina and\u2026T ynan. Oren and Amber Mavis. Tairn and Andarna choosing me. Xaden kissing me. Our mother ignoring me.",
  "Mira pulls me back just long enough to look me over, as if she\u2019s checking for damage. \u201cYou\u2019re all right.\u201d She nods, her teeth digging into her bottom lip. \u201cY ou\u2019re all right, aren\u2019 t you?\u201d I nod, but she blurs in my vision because I might be alive, thriving even, but I\u2019m not the same person she left at the base of that turret, and from the heaviness in her eyes, she knows it, too. \u201cYeah,\u201d she whispers, tucking me in tight again. \u201cYou\u2019re all right, Violet. You\u2019re all right.\u201d If she says it enough times, I might start to believe her . \u201cAre you?\u201d I jerk back to study her . There\u2019 s a new scar that stretches from her earlobe to her collarbone. \u201cGods, Mira.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she promises, then grins. \u201cAnd look at you! Y ou didn\u2019 t die!\u201d Irrational, giddy laughter bubbles up. \u201cI didn\u2019 t die! You\u2019re not an only child!\u201d We both burst into laughter , and tears track down my cheeks. \u201cSorrengails are weird,\u201d I hear Imogen state. \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Dain answ ers, but when I turn to look, his lips are curved into the first genuine smile I\u2019ve seen from him in months.",
  "\u201cShut up, Aetos,\u201d Mira barks, throwing her arm over my shoulder . \u201cCatch me up on everything, V iolet.\u201d We might be hundreds of miles from Basgiath, but I\u2019ve never felt more at home. \u2026 It\u2019s early evenin g two days later, just after dinner , when Rhia nnon and Iclimb out our first-story windo w and drop to the ground.

  "Fine, I definitely deserve. \u201cIn my defense , I didn\u2019 t think you\u2019d be there,\u201d I say slowly . \u201cBecause you\u2019re supposed to be on patrol.\u201d \u201cYou were actin g super weird at dinner .\u201d She tilts her head to the side and studies me just like we\u2019re kids again, seeing way too much. \u201cSo I switched shifts. Do you want to tell me what you\u2019re doing outside the walls?\u201d I glance at Rhiannon, and she looks away . \u201cNeither of you? Really?\u201d She sighs and rubs the bridge of her nose. \u201cYou two need to sneak out of a heavily fortified defensi ve position because\u2026?\u201d I look up at Rhiannon. \u201cShe\u2019 s going to figure it out anyway . She\u2019s like a bloodhound with stuf f like this. T rust me.\u201d My stomach clenches. Rhiannon tilts her chin. \u201cW e\u2019re flying to my family\u2019 s house.\u201d Mira blanches. \u201cY ou think you\u2019re what ?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re flying to her village. It\u2019s like a five-minute flight, according to Tairn, and\u2014\u201d I start. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Mira shakes her head. \u201cNope.",
  "You cannot fly off like you\u2019re on vacation. What if something happens to you?\u201d \u201cAt her parents\u2019 house?\u201d I ask slowly . \u201cBecause there\u2019 s some majorambush planned on the of f chance that we might just be dropping in?\u201d Mira\u2019 s eyes narrow . Shit. This is not going well and, given the death grip Rhiannon has on my arm now , she doesn\u2019 t think so, either . \u201cWe\u2019d be in less danger visiting her parents than we are at Basgiath,\u201d I argue. Mira\u2019 s lips purse. \u201cFair point.\u201d \u201cCome with us,\u201d I blurt. \u201cSeriously . Come with us, Mira. She just wants to see her sister .\u201d Mira\u2019 s shoulders dip. She\u2019 s softening, and I mercilessly go in for the kill. \u201cRaegan was pregnant when Rhiannon left. Can you imagine not being there with me if I had a kid?",
  "Wouldn\u2019 t you do anything, including escape a heavily fortified defensive position, if that meant holding your niece or nephew?\u201d My nose scrunches as I brace for her answer . \u201cBesides, with the hero of Strythmore at our side, what could possibly go wrong?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t even start with that.\u201d She looks at me, then Rhiannon, then back at me again before groaning. \u201cOh, fucking fine.\u201d Her finger comes out swinging when we both grin. \u201cBut if you even think about telling anyone, I\u2019ll make you regret it for the rest of your natural life.\u201d \u201cShe means it,\u201d I whisper . \u201cI believe it,\u201d Rhiannon answers. \u201cYou\u2019re here two days and already breaking the rules,\u201d Mira mutters. \u201c Come on , it \u2019 s quicker to cut down this path. \u201d An hour later , Mira and I are stretched out on the cushioned benches that flank both sides of the dining table at Raegan \u2019 s house , watchin g Rhiannon rock her nephew by the fireplace",
  ", lost in conversation with her sister as her parents and brother -in-law look on from the nearby couch . Watching them reunite is worth everything. \u201cThank you for helping us.\u201d I glance over the table at Mira. \u201cYou would have done it with or without me.\u201d Her smile is soft as shewatches the family , curling her hand around the pewter mug of wine Rhiannon\u2019 s mom was kind enough to bring earlier . \u201cFigured at least this way I\u2019d know you\u2019re safe. What other rules have you broken, sis?\u201d She sips her wine and cuts a look my way . A smirk tugs at my mouth as I lift one shoulder . \u201cMaybe a few here and there. I\u2019ve gotten very good at poisoning my opponents before challenges.\u201d Mira nearly spits out her wine, slamming her hand over her mouth. I laugh, crossing one booted ankle over the other . \u201cNot what you were expecting?\u201d Respect shines in her eyes. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what I expected. I was just desperate for you to live.",
  "And then you went and not only bonded one of the most powerful dragons alive but a feathertail, too.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cMy baby sister is a badass.\u201d \u201cNot sure Mom would agree with that.\u201d I rub my thumb over the handle of my mug. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly manifesting a signet yet. I\u2019m solid at grounding and can hold a pretty strong shield, but\u2026\u201d I can\u2019t tell her the rest, the gift Andarna has given, at least for now, to me. \u201cIf I don\u2019t manifest my signet soon\u2026\u201d We both know what will happen. She quietly studies me in that way she has, then says, \u201cHere\u2019 s the thing. If you want your signet to manife st, then stop blocking it by thinking it has anything to do with Mom. Y our power is yours and yours alone, V i.\u201d I squirm under her scrutiny and change the subject, my gaze dropping to her neck. \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d \u201cGryphon,\u201d she answers, nodding.",
  "\u201cNear the village of Cranston about seven months ago. Thing came out of nowhere in the middle of a village raid.

  "I\u2026\u201d Common sense tells me to shut my mouth. \u201cYou what?\u201d She takes another drink. \u201cI think there\u2019 s way more going on along the borders than what we\u2019re told,\u201d I admit quietly . Mira lifts her brows. \u201cWell, of course there is. You don\u2019t expect Battle Brief to relay classified information, do you? You know better than that. And honestly, at the rate our borders are being attacked, they\u2019d have to devote all day to Battle Brief in order to dissect each assault.\u201d \u201cThat makes sense. Do you guys get all the information?\u201d \u201cOnly what we need. Like, I could have sworn I saw a riot of dragons across the border during this attack.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBut questions about secret operations are above my pay grade. Think of it this way\u2014if you were a healer , would you need to know the details about everyone else\u2019s patients?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cExactly . Now tell me, what the fuck is going on between you and Dain?

He wouldn\u2019 t let me.\u201d It was the simplest explanation for the last nine months. \u201cI got his friend Amber killed. She was a wingleader .",

  "Not to what it was, at least.\u201d \u201cThe execution of that winglead er is common knowledge. You didn\u2019 t get her killed. She got herself killed by breaking the Codex.\u201d Mira studies me for a quiet moment. \u201cIs it true Riorson saved you that night?\u201d I nod. \u201cXaden is a complicate d subject.\u201d So complicated that I can\u2019t identify my own feelings. Think ing of him only jumbles me in a way that leaves me tangled in knots. I want him, but I can\u2019t trust him, not in the waysI want to. And yet in other ways, he\u2019 s the person I trust most. \u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing there.\u201d Her grip tightens on her mug. \u201cBecause I distinctly remember warning you to steer clear of that traitor \u2019s son.\u201d My stomach turns at Mira\u2019 s description of Xaden. \u201cTairn clearly didn\u2019 t heed the warning.\u201d She snorts. \u201cBut really, if Xaden hadn\u2019 t shown up that night, or if I hadn\u2019t been sleeping in the armor\u2026\u201d I pause and lean forward to touch her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you how many times you\u2019ve saved my life without even being there.\u201d Mira smiles. \u201cGlad it worked.",
  "I swear it took an entire molting season to collect all those scales.\u201d \u201cHave you thought of telling Mom about it? Getting them made for all riders?\u201d \u201cI told my leadership.\u201d She leans back and takes another drink. \u201cThey said they\u2019re looking into it.\u201d We watch Rhiannon kiss her nephew\u2019 s perfect chubby cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a family this happy ,\u201d I admit. \u201cEven when Brennan and Dad were alive, we weren\u2019 t like\u2026that.\u201d \u201cNo, we weren\u2019 t.\u201d A sad smile curves her mouth as she looks at me. \u201cBut I can remember plenty of night s we spent curled around the fire with Dad and that book you love.\u201d \u201cAh yes, the book you made me leave in my old bedroom.\u201d I arch a brow . \u201cYou mean the book I snagged just in case Mom got a wild hair and decided to clean out your things while you were in the quadrant?\u201d Her smile morphs into a grin. \u201cI have it at Montserrat. Figured you\u2019d be pissed if you graduated and it was gone. I mean, whatever would you do if you forgot a minute detail of how the gallant riders took out the army of wyvern and the venin who sucked the land dry of magic?\u201dI blink. \u201cShit. I can\u2019t remember .",
  "But I guess I\u2019ll be able to read it again soon!\u201d A bubble of joy rises in my chest. \u201cY ou are the best.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll give it to you at the outpost.\u201d She leans back and gives me a thoughtful look. \u201cI know they\u2019re just stories, but I never used to get why the villains would choose to corrupt their souls and become venin, and now\u2026\u201d Her brow furrows. \u201cNow you empathize with the villain?\u201d I tease. \u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cBut we have the kind of power people would kill for, Violet. Dragons and gryphons are the gatekeepers, and I\u2019m sure that to someone jealous enough, ambitious enough, risking a soul would be a fair price for the ability to wield.\u201d Her shoulders rise as she shrugs. \u201cJust makes me glad our dragons are so discerning and our wards keep the gryphon riders at bay. Who the hell knows what kind of people those furry creatures choose?\u201d We stay another hour, until we know we\u2019re risking exposure if we stay a minute longer . Then Mira and I give Rhiannon some privacy to say goodbye to her family and head out of the house into the humid night. Tairn has been uncharacteristically quiet the last couple of hours.",
  "\u201cHave you been stationed with any riders of mated pairs?\u201d I ask Mira as I close the door behind us. \u201cOne,\u201d she answ ers, her eyes narrowing on the darkened path in front of the house. \u201c Why ? \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m just wondering how long they can be separated. \u201d \u201c Turns out , about three days is their max. \u201d Xaden steps out of the shadows.For valor above and beyond the call of duty in the battle of Strythmor e , wher e her bravery r esulted not only in the destruction of a battery behind enemy lines but also saved the lives of an entir e company of infantry",
  ", I recommend Mira Sorr engail r eceive the Star of Navarr e. But if the criterion is not met , which I assur e you it has been , downgrading to the Order of the T alon would be a shame , but sufficient . \u2014R ECOMMENDA TION FOR AWARD FROM MAJOR POTSDAM TO GENERAL SORRENGAIL CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN \u201cSo all we do is wait for something to happen?\u201d Ridoc asks the next afternoon, leanin g back in his chair and putting his boots on the end of the wooden table that runs the length of the briefing room. \u201cYes,\u201d Mira says from the head of the table, then flicks her wrist and sends Ridoc flying backward. \u201cAnd keep your feet of f the table.\u201d One of the Montserrat riders laughs, changing the markers on the large map that consum es the only stone wall in the curved, windowed room.",
  "This is the highest turret in the outpo st, offering unmatched views of the Esben mountain range around us. We\u2019ve been split into two group s for the day. Rhiannon, Sawyer , Cianna, Nadine, and Heaton spent the morning with Devera in this room, studying previous battles at the outpost, and are now out on patrol. Dain, Ridoc, Liam, Emery , Quinn, and I spent the morning on a two-hour flight around the surrounding area, with one extra tagalong\u2014Xaden. He\u2019s been the worst kind of distraction since arriving last night. Dain won\u2019 t stop glaring at him and making snide remarks.Mira keeps one eye on him at all times as well, suspiciously quiet since last night. And me? I can\u2019t seem to keep my eyes to myself. There\u2019 s a palpable energy in every room he enters , and it brushes over my skin like a caress each time our eyes meet. Even now, I\u2019m aware of every breath he takes as he sits next to me midway down the table. \u201cConsider this your Battle Brief,\u201d Mira continues, side-eyeing Ridoc as he scram bles back into his chair . \u201cThis morning was about a quarter of the patrol we\u2019d regularly fly, so normally we\u2019d just be getting back about now and reporting our findings to the commander .",
  "But for the sake of killing time , since we \u2019 re in this room as the reaction flight for this afternoon , let \u2019 s pretend we \u2019 d come across a newly fortified enemy outpost crossing our border \u201d \u2014she turns to the map and sticks a pin with a small crimson flag near one of the peaks about two miles from the Cygnisen borderline \u2014 \u201c here. \u201d \u201c We \u2019 re suppose d to pretend it just popped up overnight ? \u201d Emery asks , openly skeptical . \u201cFor the sake of argument, third-year .\u201d Mira narrows her eyes on him, and he sits up a little straighter . \u201cI like this game ,\u201d another one of the Montserrat riders says from the end of the table, lacing his fingers behind his neck.",
  "\u201cWhat would our objective be?\u201d Mira glances around the table, noticeably skipp ing Xaden. Last night, she\u2019d taken one look at the rebellion relic on his neck and walked by without saying a word. \u201cAetos?\u201d Dain startles from where he was glowering across the table at Xaden and turns to face the map. \u201cWhat type of fortifications are there? Are we talking a haphazard wooden structure? Or something more substantial?\u201d \u201cLike they had time to build a fortress overnight,\u201d Ridoc mutte rs. \u201cIt has to be wooden, right?\u201d \u201cYou are all so fucking literal.\u201d Mira sighs and rubs her thumb over herforehead. \u201cFine, let\u2019s say they occupied a keep that\u2019s already established. Stone and all.\u201d \u201cBut the civilians didn\u2019 t call for help?\u201d Quinn asks, scratching her pointed chin. \u201cProtocol calls for a distress signal this far into the mountains. They should have lit their distress beacon, alerting patrollin g riders, at which time the dragons on patrol would have told all available dragons in the area. The very riders in this room would have mounted first as the reaction force and the others would have been woken from their rests, allowing the riders to prevent the loss of the keep in the first place.\u201d Mira scoffs and braces her hands on the end of the table, staring us all down.",
  "\u201cEverything you\u2019re taught at Basgiath is theory . You analyze past attacks and learn those very\u2026theoretical combat maneuvers. But things out here don\u2019t always go according to plan. So why don\u2019t we talk about all the ways things can go sideways, so you\u2019ll know what to do when they do, as opposed to ar guing that the keep shouldn\u2019 t have fallen?\u201d Quinn shifts her weight uncomfortably . \u201cHow many of you have been called out as third-years?\u201d Mira stands straight, folding her arms over her black leathers and the strap that holds her sword to her back. Emery and Xaden raise their hands, though Xaden\u2019 s is barely a gesture. Dain looks like his head is about to explode.",
  "\u201cThat\u2019 s not correct. We\u2019re never called into service until graduation.\u201d Xaden presses his lips in a tight line and nods, giving him a sarcastic thumbs-up. \u201cYeah, all right.\u201d Emery laughs. \u201cJust wait until next year. I can\u2019t count how many times we\u2019re the ones sitting in these very rooms in the midland forts because their riders have been called to the front for an emer gency .\u201d The color drains from Dain\u2019 s face. \u201cNow that\u2019s settled.\u201d Mira reaches under the table and pulls out a set of models, putting a six-inch stone keep in the center of the table. \u201cCatch.\u201dOne by one, she tosses painted wooden models of dragons at us, keeping one for herself. \u201cPretend Messina and Exal don\u2019 t exist back there, and we\u2019re the only squad available to take back that keep. Think of the power in this room.",
  "Think of what each individual rider brings to the table and how you\u2019d use those powers in unison to conquer your objective.\u201d \u201cBut they don\u2019t teach that to first-years,\u201d Liam says slowly from the other side of me. Mira glances at the whirls of magic on his wrist, but to Liam\u2019 s credit, he doesn\u2019 t tug his sleeve down. It\u2019s hard to remember sometimes that the third- years are the first riders who will serve with the children of the leaders of the T yrrish uprising\u2014an uprising that could have left our borders eventually defenseless and the innocent people of Navarre war casualties. Everyone in this room has become accustomed to Liam, Imogen\u2026even Xaden. But those in active service have never flown with anyone marked by a rebellion relic. The Tyrrish riders who remained loyal to Navarre during the uprising were promoted, not punished, and the riders who turned against king and country were killed or executed . And just like my grief at Brennan\u2019 s loss was directed at Xaden that first day at the parapet, there will be more than one rider who misdirects their own anger at marked riders.",
  "I clear my throat. Mira\u2019 s gaze meets mine, and I lift an eyebrow at her in clear warning. Don\u2019 t fuck with my friends. Her eyes widen ever so slightl y, and she directs her attention back to Liam. \u201cThey might not teach you this battle strategy as first-ye ars because you\u2019re all busy trying to stay on your dragons. You had your first taste of strategy during the Squad Battle, and it\u2019s almost May, which means final War Games should be beginning, right?\u201d \u201cTwo weeks,\u201d Dain answers. \u201cGood timing, then. Not all of you will survive the games if you\u2019re notprepared.\u201d She holds my gaze for a beat. \u201cThis kind of thinking will give your squad\u2014your entire wing\u2014an advantage, since I guarantee your wingleader is already assessing every rider for their own abilities.\u201d Xaden flips his dragon model over his knuckles but doesn\u2019 t reply . He hasn\u2019 t spoken a word to Mira since arriving.",
  "\u201cSo let\u2019s do this.\u201d Mira stands back. \u201cWho is in command?\u201d She glances toward Quinn. \u201cAnd let\u2019s pretend that I don\u2019t have three years of seniority on even the highest-ranked of you.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019m in command.\u201d Dain sits up straight, his chin rising a good inch. \u201cOur wingleader is here,\u201d Liam argues, pointing at Xaden. \u201cI would say that puts him in command.\u201d \u201cWe can pretend I\u2019m not here, just for the sake of the exercise.\u201d Xaden sets his dragon on the table and leans back in his chair , draping his arm across the back of mine, a move that makes Dain grit his teeth. \u201cGive Aetos here the position we all know he craves.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t be a dick,\u201d I whisper . \u201cYou haven\u2019 t even seen me start to be a dick.\u201d My head turns so fast that it swims, and my mouth drops open as I stare at the side of Xaden\u2019 s face. That was his voice\u2026in my fucking head . He turns , the golden flecks in his eyes catching the light, and I swear I hear him laughing in my mind , though his lips are closed, tilted in that pulse-quickening smirk of his. \u201cYou\u2019re staring. It\u2019s going to get awkwar d in about thirty seconds if you don\u2019t stop.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d I hiss.",
  "\u201cThe same way you talk to Sgaeyl. We\u2019re all gloriously , annoyingly linked. This is just one of the perks. Though I\u2019m starting to wish I\u2019d tried it sooner . The look on your face is priceless.\u201d He winks and turns back to the table.He. Fucking. Winked. And is that a hint of a smile? \u201cYou\u2019re. The. Wingleader .\u201d Every word Dain speaks comes out through clenched teeth. \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to be here.\u201d Xaden shrugs. \u201cBut if it makes you feel better , for the purpose of War Games, you\u2019d be getting your orders from your sectio n leader , Garrick Tavis, which he\u2019d get from me. You\u2019ll be carrying out your maneuvers as a squad for the good of the wing. Just pretend I\u2019m another member of your squad and use me as you wish, Aetos.\u201d Xaden folds his arms across his chest. I glance at Mira, who\u2019 s watching the play-by-play with raised brows.",
  "\u201cWhy are you even here?\u201d Dain challenges. \u201cNo offense, sir, but we weren\u2019 t exactly expecting senior leadership on this trip.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re more than aware that Sgaeyl and T airn are mated.\u201d \u201cThree days?\u201d Dain fires back, leaning in. \u201cYou couldn\u2019 t make it three days?\u201d \u201cIt has nothing to do with him,\u201d I interrupt, setting my dragon down with a little more force than necessary . \u201cThat\u2019 s up to T airn and Sgaeyl.\u201d \u201cYou never consider ed that it was you I couldn\u2019 t stay away fr om?\u201d I crook my right arm and jab it into Xaden\u2019 s biceps. He doesn\u2019t mean that. Not when he\u2019s still adamant that kissing me was a mistake. And if he does\u2026 I\u2019m not going there. \u201cNow , now, you\u2019ll give our little communication secret away if you can\u2019t keep from being so\u2026violent.\u201d He barely restrains a smile, obviously loving that he gets the last word. I need to figure out how the hell he\u2019s doing it so I can menta lly argue back.",
  "\u201cOf course you rush to defend him.\u201d Dain hurls a hurt glare at me. \u201cThough how you can for get that this guy wanted to kill you six months ago is beyond me.\u201d I blink up at him. \u201cI cannot believe you went there.\u201d\u201cGood job remaining professional, Aetos.\u201d Xaden scratches the relic on his neck I\u2019m all but certain doesn\u2019 t actually itch. \u201cReally shows those leadership qualities to their best advantage.\u201d One of the rider s down the table whistles low. \u201cDo you boys just want to whip it out and measure?",
  "It would be faster .\u201d Liam smothers a laugh, but his shoulders shake. \u201cEnough!\u201d Mira slams her hands on the table. \u201cOh, come on, Sorrengail,\u201d the rider down the table whines with a wide smile. Both Mira and I look his way . \u201cI mean\u2026the older Sorrengail. This is the best entertainment we\u2019ve had in ages.\u201d I shake my head and look around the table. \u201cMira has the ability to extend the shield if the wards are down, so the first thing I would do is send her to scout the area with T eine. W e need to know if we\u2019re dealing with infantry or gryphon riders.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d Mira moves her drago n closer to the castle. \u201cNow let\u2019s assume there are gryphons.\u201d \u201cYou want to do your job?\u201d I ask Dain, smiling sweetly . \u201cI mean, how you can for get you\u2019re the squad leader is beyond me.\u201d His hand clenches around his own dragon as he rips his gaze from mine. \u201cQuinn, can you astral project from the back of your dragon?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she answers. \u201cThen I would have you projec t into the fortress to check for signs of weakness,\u201d Dain orders. \u201cAnd have you report back. Same with Liam.",
  "We\u2019d use your farsight to see if you can locate where the grypho n riders are and if there are any traps.\u201d \u201cGood. The weaknesses are the wooden gate,\u201d Mira notes as Quinn and Liam move their dragons into position, \u201cand the Navarrian citizens they have captive in the dungeons.\u201d\u201cSo much for blasting the whole place,\u201d Ridoc says. \u201cYou\u2019re an air wielder , right?\u201d Dain asks Emery . \u201cSo you can shape your dragon\u2019 s flames, lead them through the occupied parts of the keep without killing civilians.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Emery answers. \u201cBut I\u2019d have to be in the keep.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to get into the keep,\u201d Mira says with a shrug. Emery\u2019 s eyes widen. \u201cY ou want me to leave my dragon and go on foot?\u201d \u201cWhy do you think we get all that hand-to-hand training? Or are you going to leave all those innocen t people to die?\u201d Mira flicks her wrist and Emery\u2019 s dragon goes flying out of his hand and into hers. She puts it in the center of the keep.",
  "\u201cThe real question is, how do we get you close enough without getting you killed?\u201d She glances around the table. \u201cSince I\u2019m guessing the others will be busy fighting off the gryphons that launch once the fireworks start.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019 s your signet, Aetos?\u201d Quinn asks. \u201cAbove your pay grade,\u201d Dain answers, glancing around the table and skipping over Xaden, then making the rounds again, finally sighing. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d Is the quadrant really making Dain keep the memory reading secret? Had him reaching for my head the day Amber burned been a loss of control? How has he gotten this far without telling anyone what his signet is?",
  "I shake my head. \u201cSure.\u201d I pick up Xaden\u2019 s dragon and shove it toward the keep , planting one mental foot in the Archives where I keep my power and using it to lift the dragon figurine into a hover above the structure. \u201cYou stop ignoring that you have an incredibly powerful shadow wielder at your disposal and ask him to black out the area so no one sees you land.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019 s not wrong,\u201d Mira agrees, but her words are clipped. \u201cYou can do that?\u201d Dain begrudgingly looks at Xaden. \u201cAre you seriously asking?\u201d Xaden retorts.\u201cJust wasn\u2019 t sure you could cover an area that\u2014\u201d Xaden lifts a hand a few inches above the table, and shadows pour from underneath our seats, filling the room and turning it dark as midnight in a blink. My heart jumps as my sight goes black. \u201cRelax. It\u2019 s just me.\u201d A ghost of a touch skims my cheek. Just him is slight ly\u2026terrifying. I shove that thought at him, but there\u2019 s no response. Maybe we have a one-way-communication thing going on over here, because I don\u2019 t think I can talk to him the way he does me.",
  "What had Sgaey l said about signets? It reflects who you are at the core of your being. It makes sense. Mira is protective. Dain has to know everything. And Xaden\u2026has secrets. \u201cFuck me,\u201d someone says. \u201cI can surround this entire outpost, but I think that might freak some people out,\u201d Xaden says, and the shadows disappear , racing back under the table. I draw in a full breath, noting that everyone at the table besides Emery\u2014 who has no doubt seen Xaden pull this kind of trick before\u2014lo oks slightly greenish. Even Mira, who\u2019 s staring at Xaden like he\u2019 s a threat she needs to assess.",
  "My stomach turns. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t get any ideas while we were in the dark there,\u201d Xaden teases, and just like that, my sympathy for the ass evaporates. I don\u2019t bother to face him, just raise one finger . He chuckles, and I grit my teeth. \u201cGet him out of my head,\u201d I toss in T airn\u2019s direction. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d Tairn responds. \u201cIs this normal with all mated pairs and their riders?\u201d \u201cFor some. It\u2019 s a gr eat advantage in a battle.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019 s a pain in my ass right now .\u201d I miss Andarna. We\u2019re so far apart that I can barely feel her .\u201cThen shield him out the same way you do me\u2014or start talking back,\u201d Tairn grumbles. \u201cYou have the power to be a pain in the ass, too. T rust me.\u201d \u201cAnd how exactly am I suppose d to talk back at him?\u201d I give Xaden a heavy dose of side-eye, but he\u2019s engrossed in the ongoing battle we\u2019ve waged against an imaginary keep. \u201cFigur e out which pathway into your mind is his.\u201d Oh joy . That should be easy .",
  "We finish the hypothetical operation, each of us using our power to its best ability\u2026everyone except me. But when it\u2019s time to take the gryphons out in the air , Tairn overpowers every other dragon in the room.",
  "\u201cGood job,\u201d Mira says, glancing at her pocket watch. \u201cAetos, Riorson, and Sorrengail, I want to see you in the hallway . The rest of you are dismissed.\u201d It\u2019s not like any of us has an option, so we follow Mira out to the spiral staircase. She shuts the door behind us and throws up a line of blue energy that covers the entrance. \u201cSound shield,\u201d Dain says with a smile. \u201cNice.\u201d \u201cShut up.\u201d Mira spins on the top step, putting her finger in Dain\u2019 s face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what bug has craw led up your ass, Dain Aetos, but have you forgotten that you\u2019re a squad leader? That you have a very real chance of becoming a wingleader next year?\u201d Oh shit, she\u2019s pissed, and that\u2019s not anything I want a part of. I retreat another step, but with Xaden beneath me on the stairs, there\u2019 s nowhere left to go. \u201cMira\u2014\u201d Dain starts. \u201cLieutenant Sorrengail,\u201d Mira responds. \u201cY ou\u2019re blowing it, Dain. I know how badly you want his job next year .\u201d She points a finger at Xaden. \u201cDon\u2019 t forget that we\u2019v e grown up about ten feet apart.",
  "And you are blowing it, because what? Y ou\u2019re pissed that V iolet bonded his dragon\u2019 s mate?\u201dHeat stings my cheeks. She\u2019s never been one to mince words, but just\u2026 damn. \u201cHe is the worst possible thing for her!\u201d Dain counters. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not arguing that.\u201d She leans into his space. \u201cBut there \u2019s nothing anyone can do about the choices of dragons. They don\u2019t bother with the opinions of mere humans, do they? But whatever is going on between the two of you\u201d\u2014that finger swin gs between Dain and me\u2014\u201cis fucking up your squad. If I can see it after four days with you, then they sure as hell can tell. And if I\u2019d known that you were going to be such a hard-ass with zero flexibility for the things she can\u2019t control, I never would have told her to find you after crossing the parapet.\u201d She glances at me, then back at him. \u201cYou two have been best friends since you were five years old.

There\u2019 s no way I can flee to safety and leave my sister here, with absolutely zero way of knowing if she\u2019s alive or dead.

It takes mere minutes to grab my pack and Rhiannon\u2019 s, since we\u2019ve left them intact, even cramming in our cloaks. Then I\u2019m back in the hallway where Xaden waits, his own pack slung over his shoulder . It looks considerably smaller than the one he arrived with, and I don\u2019t want to even think about what he\u2019 s left behind in order to force me out faster . I don\u2019t bother looking at him, marching for the door, but he grabs my elbow and spins me around.",
  "\u201cNope. It\u2019s too dangerous to leave the fortress walls.

Think of every other first-year .\u201d The plea in his eyes shuts my mouth. \u201cAre you going to sentence an entire untrained squad to death? Because I\u2019ll make it. Cianna, Emery , and Heaton will, too. And we all fucking know Riorson will. But what about Rhiannon? Ridoc? Sawyer?",
  "You want their deaths on your hands?\u201d he asks, his words choppy as we race upward toward the open door .This isn\u2019 t about me. We burst onto the roof as Emery mounts his dragon, who is precariously perched on the thinner -than-quadrant wall. Oh gods, I\u2019m never going to be able to mount T airn at this angle. \u201cRidoc and Quinn are already in the air,\u201d Liam tells us as Emery launches skyward, where Cath and Deigh hover , their wings beating the air . \u201cYou\u2019re next!\u201d Xaden shouts at Liam, and Dain nods.

Go.\u201d \u201cGo,\u201d I urge. I\u2019d never be able to live with myself if something happened to Dain on my account.

  "Dain looks like he\u2019s about to fight but finally nods, turning to Xaden. \u201cI\u2019m trusting you to get her out.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019 s a lot of that going around today ,\u201d Xaden retorts. \u201cNow get on your dragon so I can get her on hers.\u201d Dain gives me a long, intense look, then turns and runs, racing up Cath\u2019 s foreleg in a way that\u2019 s so reminiscent of the Gauntlet that I get flashbacks. \u201cWher e are you?\u201d I ask T airn, seeing empty skies above us. \u201cAlmost ther e. I was doing what could be done.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d I say to Xaden, turning in his arms to face him. \u201cThe others are gone.",

I just have to.\u201d There\u2019 s so much compassion, so much understanding in his eyes, thatwhen he lets go of my waist, I think he might just let me stay. Then his hands are on my cheeks, sliding back to cup the base of my neck as he brings his mouth to mine. The kiss is reckless and consum ing, and I give it my all, knowin g it might be the last one. His tongue licks into my mouth with an urgency I return, angling to take him deeper . Gods, it\u2019s not just as good as I\u2019d been fantasizing about, remembering that night. It\u2019s so much better . He was careful with me against that wall, but there is nothing hesitant about the way he lays claim to my mouth, nothing cautious about the ache that pulses low in my stomach. He only breaks the kiss when we\u2019re both panting, then rests his forehead against mine. \u201cLeave for me, Violet.\u201d \u201cAlmost ther e,\u201d Tairn says. Xaden\u2019 s been stalling to give Tairn and Sgaeyl time to arrive.",
  "My heart sinks like a rock, pinning my feet in place. \u201cI will hate you for this.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d He nods, a flash of pure regret crossing his face as he draws away . \u201cI can live with that.\u201d His hands fall away from my face and reach for my arms, lifting them so I\u2019m shaped like a T . \u201cArms up.

I instinctively knew the scars were private, but his reaction says there\u2019 s more to them than just a painful memory . \u201cWhy don\u2019 t you want to tell me?\u201d Sgaeyl startles, then launches into the air , leaving T airn and me behind. \u201cAre you pushing for a r eason?\u201d Tairn asks. \u201cCan you give me one not to?\u201d \u201cHe car es for you. That\u2019 s already har d enough for him.\u201d I scof f. \u201cHe car es about keeping me alive. Ther e\u2019s a differ ence.\u201d \u201cNot for him ther e isn\u2019 t.\u201d \u2026 The afternoon skies above Basgiath are crystal clear in the middle of May for the first battle of the War Games that signify the approach of graduation.",
  "As much as I want to feel excite ment that I\u2019m so close to actually surviving my first year in the Riders Quadrant, my stomach is tight with anxiety .",
  "Battle Briefs are getting more redacted. Professor Carr is getting more anxious that I haven\u2019 t manifested a signet like almost the entire first-year cadets. Dain is acting weird as fuck\u2014friendly one minute and indifferent the next. Xaden is getting more secretive\u2014if that were even possible\u2014 canceling some of our training for unexplained reasons. Even Tairn feels like there\u2019 s something he\u2019 s not telling me. \u201cWhat do you think our assignment is going to be?\u201d Liam asks from my right as we stand in formation in the center of the courtyard with the rest ofFourth W ing. \u201cDeigh thinks we\u2019re on of fense. He won\u2019 t stop going on about getting to kick Gleann\u2019 s ass\u2014\u201d He pauses, as if listening to his dragon. \u201cGuess dragons hold grudges,\u201d he finally whispers. Leadership is gathered ahead of us, getting their assignme nts from Xaden. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely on offense,\u201d Rhiannon answers from my left. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019d already be in the field. I haven\u2019 t seen a singl e rider from First W ing since lunch.\u201d My stomach bottoms out. First Wing. Go figure they\u2019d be our first opponent.",
  "Anything goes out there during War Games, and Jack Barlowe hasn\u2019 t forgotten that I put him in the infirmary for four days. He gave me a wider berth for weeks after Xaden executed Oren and the other kids who had attacked me\u2014and of cours e everyone stopped fucking with me after Amber Mavis. But still, I\u2019d catch a look from him as we passed in the halls or in the cafeteria, pure hatred burning in the glacial blue depths of his eyes. \u201cI think she\u2019s right,\u201d I tell Liam , struggling not to fidget as the sun bakes through my flight leathers. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve envied the scribes and their cream uniforms, but this weather has me feeling like we got the shorter end of the uniform stick . It also doesn\u2019 t help that I must have slept wrong, because my knee is killing me, and the stabilizing wrap feels like it\u2019 s a million degrees. \u201cWhy do you think riders wear black anyway?\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019 s badass,\u201d Ridoc answers from behind me. \u201cSo it\u2019 s harder to see when we bleed,\u201d Imogen chimes in. \u201cForget I asked,\u201d I mumble, watching for any signs that the leadership meeting will be over soon. Bleeding is the last thing I want to do today .",
  "\u201cAre we on offense or defense?\u201d I ask Xaden. \u201cLittle busy right now .\u201d \u201cOh no, am I distracting you?\u201d A smile curves my mouth. Shit, am I flirting? Maybe. Do I care? Oddly enough\u2026no.\u201cYes.\u201d His tone is so gruff that I have to press my lips in a tight line to keep from laughing. \u201cCome on. Y ou\u2019re taking for ever over ther e. Give a girl a hint.\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d he grow ls, but he doesn\u2019 t shut me out with his shields\u2014which I know he can do\u2014so I have a little mercy on him and the meeting he\u2019s supposed to be leading and leave him be. Offense and defense? This afternoon should be interesting. \u201cYou hear from Mira?\u201d Rhiannon whispers, shooting me a quick glance. I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019 s just\u2026inhumane.\u201d \u201cDid you honestly think they\u2019d break the no-correspondence rule? Even if they tried, Mom would have shut that down with a quickness.\u201d Rhiannon sighs, and I don\u2019t blame her. There\u2019 s not much more to say on the subject.",
  "The leadership meeting breaks up, and Dain heads over with Cianna. He\u2019 s practically beaming, his hands clenching and unclenching with nervous energy. \u201cWhich is it?\u201d Heaton asks. \u201cOf fense or defense?\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d he says as the other squad leaders report back to their riders. I fake surprise and glance past him, but Xaden and the section leaders are nowhere to be seen. \u201cFirst Wing has taken a defensi ve position in one of the practice forts in the mountains, and they\u2019re guarding a crystal egg,\u201d Dain tells us, and the older riders in our squad murmur with excitement.",
  "Makes sense. It\u2019s probably a symbolic nod to the different breeds of dragons bringing their eggs to Basgiath when Navarre unified. \u201cWhat are we missing?\u201d Ridoc asks. \u201cBecause you guys seemed thrilled about an egg.\u201d \u201cFrom past years, we know that eggs are worth more points,\u201d Cianna says, grinning enthusiastically . \u201cFlags have statistically been the lowest, andcaptured professors rank somewhere in the middle.\u201d \u201cBut they like to switch it up,\u201d Dain adds. \u201cThe same way we could be going for a real objective on the line only to discover it\u2019s not as valuable as we thought.\u201d \u201cSo how is this both offense and defense?\u201d Rhiannon asks. \u201cIf they have the egg, then clearly we should go get the egg.\u201d \u201cBecause we\u2019ve also been given a flag to defend and no outpo st to do it in.\u201d He grins. \u201cAnd our squad has been assigned to carry it.\u201d \u201cYou gave Dain the mission to defend Fourth W ing\u2019s flag?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hoping he learned something from your sister \u2019s lesson at Montserrat,\u201d Xaden replies, but his voice is quieter , which I\u2019m starting to learn means he\u2019s farther away . I can\u2019t help but wonder if we\u2019ll have the ability to communicate this way in a few months when more distance separates us. My chest aches at the thought that he won\u2019 t be here.",
  "He\u2019ll be risking his life on the front lines. \u201cAnd who is going to carry this flag?\u201d Imogen asks. Dain somehow manages to smile even wider . \u201cThat\u2019 s going to be the fun part.\u201d Over the next twenty minutes, we\u2019re drilled in strategy during the walk over to the fligh t field, and from the sound of it, Dain was paying attention to Mira. The plan is simple: play to our individual strengths and pass the flag often, never giving First W ing a chance to spot who is carrying it. When we get to the flight field, there are dozens upon dozens of dragons filling the mudd y field, all posit ioned as though they had forma tion in their squads, too. It\u2019 s easy to spot T airn, seeing as his head rises above all others. There\u2019 s a palpable air of anticip ation as we walk by the other squads, all mounting as the squad and section leaders give out last-minute orders. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win,\u201d Rhianno n says with confidence, linking her armwith mine as we approach our section of the field. \u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d \u201cWe have you, Tairn, Riorson, and Sgaeyl.",
  "And obviously\u2014me.\u201d She grins. \u201cThere\u2019 s no way we\u2019re losing this.\u201d \u201cYou are certainly\u2014\u201d My words die as T airn comes into full view . He stands tall and proud at the front of our section, not botherin g to give deference to Cath as Dain\u2019 s dragon, but it\u2019s not his position that steals my breath. It\u2019 s the saddle strapped across his back that has me gawking. \u201cI hear it\u2019 s all the fashion,\u201d Tairn brags. \u201cThat\u2019 s\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t even have words.",
  "The black metal bands look to be intricately linked as they loop around each foreleg and come together at the front of his chest, forming a triangular plate before rising above his shoulders to a saddle with strapped, secure stirrups. \u201cThat\u2019 s a saddle.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s cool, that\u2019s what that is.\u201d Rhiannon thumps my back. \u201cAnd it looks way more comfortable than Feirge\u2019s bony spine, I\u2019ll tell you that. See you up there.\u201d She walks past T airn toward her own mount. \u201cI can\u2019 t use that.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not allowed.\u201d \u201cI decide what\u2019 s allowed and what\u2019 s not,\u201d Tairn growls, lowering his head to my level and blasting me with a chuff of steam. \u201cTher e is no rule that says a drag on cannot modify their seat to serve their rider . You have worked just as hard\u2014if not harder\u2014than every rider in this quadrant. Just because your body is built differ ently than the others doesn\u2019 t mean you don\u2019 t deserve to keep your seat.",
  "It takes more than a few strips of leather and a pommel to define a rider .\u201d \u201cHe\u2019 s right, you know ,\u201d Xaden agrees as he approaches, and I briefly wonder where he\u2019d gone that he\u2019 s back so quickly . \u201cNo one asked you.\u201d My pulse jolts and my skin flushes at the sight of him. Our uniforms make every rider look good, but Xaden takes even that up a notch with the way it cuts across the muscled lines of his body . \u201cIf you don\u2019t use it, I\u2019ll take personal offense.\u201d He folds his arms acrosshis chest and studies the riggin g. \u201cConsidering I had it made for you and just about got myself burned alive in the process of trying to get it on him.\u201d He lifts a brow at T airn. \u201cEven though he helped design it, I might add.\u201d \u201cThe first mode ls were unacceptable, and you had the gall to pinch my chest scales when clumsily assembling it this morning.\u201d Tairn\u2019s golden eyes narrow on Xaden. \u201cHow was I to know the leather from the prototype would burn so easily?",
  "And it\u2019s not like there are a lot of manuals on fitting a saddle to a dragon ,\u201d Xaden drawls. \u201cIt doesn\u2019 t matter because I can\u2019t use it.\u201d I turn to face Xaden. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, a marvel of engineering\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd?\u201d His jaw locks. \u201cAnd everyone here will know I can\u2019t keep my seat without it.\u201d Heat stings my cheeks. \u201cHate to break it to you, Violen ce, but everyone already knows that.\u201d He gestures to the saddle. \u201cThat right there is the most practical way for you to ride. It has straps across your thighs to buckle yourself in once you \u2019 re up , and theoretically , you should be able to change positions on long flights without unbuckling , since we built in a lap belt , too. \u201d \u201c Theoretically",
  "? \u201d \u201c He wasn \u2019 t amenable to me giving it a test flight. \u201d \u201c You can ride me when the flesh r ots off my bones , wingleader . \u201d Well , that \u2019 s descriptive . \u201cLook, there\u2019 s no rule against it. I checked.",
  "And if anything, you\u2019ll be doing Tairn a favor by freeing all his power and taking the weight of worry off his mind. Mine too, if that helps matters.\u201d My fingernails bite into my palm s as I search for another reason, another excuse, but there isn\u2019t one. I might not want to appear differen t than every other rider on this field, but I already am. \u201cFuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.\u201dXaden\u2019 s express ion remains bland, bored even, but his eyes heat as his gaze drops to my mouth. \u201cAnd you say this now, wher e people will see if you actually do.\u201d My breath catches. \u201cWhen did I ever give you the impression that I give a fuck what people think about me?\u201d A corner of his mouth rises, and now it\u2019s all I can concentrate on, damn him . \u201cI only car e what they think about you.\u201d Because he\u2019 s a wingleader .",
  "Nothing is worse than cadets gossiping that you\u2019ve slept your way to safety . That\u2019 s what Mira warned at Parapet. \u201cMount up, Sorrengail. W e have a battle to win.\u201d I rip my gaze from his and study the exquisite, intricate structu re of the saddle. \u201cIt\u2019 s beautiful. Thank you, Xaden.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He turns but leans into my space, and a shiver dances down my spine when his lips brush my ear . \u201cConsider my favor fulfilled.\u201d \u201cIs that a saddle?\u201d I jump back from Xaden, but he doesn\u2019 t budge an inch as Dain interrupts, holding a giant yellow flag on a four-foot pole, his eyes wide as he stares at Tairn. \u201cNo, it\u2019 s a collar ,\u201d Tairn snips, snapping his teeth together . Dain backs up a few steps. \u201cYes,\u201d Xaden answers. \u201cHave a problem with it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Dain looks at Xaden like he\u2019s being unreasonable.",
  "\u201cWhy would I have an issue with it? I\u2019m fine with whatever keeps Violet safe, if you haven\u2019 t noticed.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d Xaden nods once and turns toward me. \u201cBet it would be even more awkwar d if I kissed you now , huh?\u201d Yes, please. \u201cThe next time we kiss had better not be just to piss off Dain.\u201d The next time had better only be because we want it.\u201cNext time, huh?\u201d His gaze lowers to my mouth again. And of course, now that\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about, the feel of his lips on mine, the way his hands always cradle the nape of my neck, the slide of his tongue. I stop myself from leaning in.",
  "Barely . \u201cGo lead your wing\u2014or do whatever it is you do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be stealing an egg.\u201d His smile flashes before he turns back to Dain. \u201cKeep our flag out of First W ing\u2019s hands.\u201d Dain nods and Xaden leaves, heading across the field to where Sgaeyl waits. \u201cIt\u2019s a great saddle,\u201d Dain says. \u201cIt is,\u201d I agree, and Dain of fers me a smile before walking toward Cath. Moving toward Tairn\u2019s foreleg, I have to laugh as he dips his shoulder for me. \u201cWhat? No ladder?\u201d \u201cWe thought about it and decided it would make you too vulnerable.\u201d \u201cOf course you thought about\u2014\u201d I pause before climbing when a flash of gold gallops toward me. \u201cAndarna?\u201d \u201cI want to battle, too.\u201d She skids to a halt directly in front of me. My mouth open s and shuts. Andarna has been flying with us, and for short times, she can keep up with Tairn, but the way those scales shine in the sun is a beacon for\u2026everyone. But if I can have a saddle, then\u2014 \u201cGot it.\u201d My eyes sweep the flight field, which is at the height of its muddiest since the runof f seaso n from the snowy peaks above. \u201cGo roll.\u201d I point to the mud.",
  "\u201cUnless that\u2019s going to mess with your wings? It\u2019s the scales on your belly I\u2019m most worried about being easily spotted.\u201d \u201cNo pr oblem!\u201d She races of f, and I mount T airn, finding the actual saddle covering the seat at the base of his neck and the pommel scales. \u201cI thought you said leather was bad?\u201d The saddle itself is sumptuous black leather , complete with two raised pommels for my hands, and when I settle in, it fits like a dream. I bend and adjust the stirrups with the bucklesystem on the straps. \u201cThe leather is a hazar d on my chest if we take a fire attack, since your saddle would slide right off. But if you take a dir ect blast up ther e, sitting on a piece of metal isn\u2019 t going to save you.\u201d I don\u2019t bother pointing out that the only fire we\u2019d be taking is from other dragons, which is a problem that doesn\u2019 t exist, since gryphons are all beak and claw . Instead, I find the straps for my thighs and buckle in. \u201cThis is ingenious,\u201d I say to Xaden. \u201cLet me know if it needs modifications after we win today .\u201d Arrogant ass.",
  "We\u2019re airborne moments later, Andarna keeping up and staying tucked close to T airn just like we\u2019ve practiced. Our mission is to keep the flag out of enemy hands, so we skirt the perimeter of the hundred-mile battlefield that encompasses most of the central range while the other squads handle reconnaissance and retrieval. About an hour into the afternoon, I\u2019m wondering if this assignment is actually meant as punishment for Dain and not an honor . The twelve of us are split into two tight formations of six, seven when taking Andarna into account.",
  "Dain has the flag in his group just ahead of us, and when we reach yet another peak in the range, he splits to the right. Tairn banks to the left, and my stomach pitches as we sweep down the side of the mountain. The wide straps dig into my thighs, holding me firmly in place, and my heart thunders as pure exhilaration hits as hard as the rush of wind against my face and goggles as we dive, and dive, and dive. And for the first time, there\u2019 s no fear that I\u2019ll tumble off his back. Slowly , I unclen ch my hands from the pommels and a heartbeat later, my hands are above my head as we plummet toward the valley below . I\u2019ve lived twent y years and never felt as alive as I do in this moment. Without even grounding in my Archives, power surges in my veins, crackling with a life all its own, jolting every single one of my senses to adegree that nears pain. Tairn flares his wings, catching air and pulling out of the dive. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to work on those shoulder muscles, Silver One. We\u2019ll practice this week.\u201d Leaning as far as I can out of the saddle, I see Andarna clutched in Tairn\u2019s claw as we level out in a glide along the valley floor . \u201cThanks!",
  "I\u2019ve got it now ,\u201d Andarna says, and T airn lets her free. Power rattles my bones, as if it\u2019s looking for a way out, and I force myself upright. It\u2019s different than usual\u2026like instead of standing ready to be molded by my hands, it wants to mold me. A moment of fear skitters along my spine. What if the backlash of power from not manifesting a signet has chosen today to finally release? I shake my head. I do not have time to worry about what might happen\u2014not in the middle of the War Games. My power is just feeling free because I\u2019m finally not so focused on falling out of my seat.",
  "That\u2019 s all it is. Sitting tall in the saddle, I swee p my unsteady gaze along the landscape as Tairn begins to climb again, and my heart stutters. Up high on the western ridgelin e is a gray tower that almost blends in to the cliffside. I would have missed it if not for the\u2014 \u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d Fear only feeds the uncontrollable energy prickling my skin. Tairn\u2019s head is already turned in that direction. \u201cDragons.\u201d I glance over my shoulder toward Liam and Rhiannon and see that Tairn must have relayed the message, because we break formation, scattering as three dragons launch from the clif f above us, diving in dif ferent directions. We\u2019ve given them multiple tar gets, but now we\u2019ll face them one-on-one.",
  "A hail of ice pellets strikes my skin, bouncing off Tairn\u2019s scales, but he\u2019s forced to tuck his wings in tight to avoid damage. My stom ach launches into my throat as we free-fall, the valley floor rising up at us at an alarming rate. Heat and energy threaten to devour everyinch of my body , and even my eyes feel like they\u2019re on fire. Oh fuck, my signet is going to backlash against me during the games. \u201cGround now!\u201d Tairn roars. I slam my eyes shut, throwing both mental feet onto the marble floor of the Archives and throwing up the walls around me, only leavin g entrances for Tairn\u2019s torrent of power , Andarna, and access to Xaden, and I immediately feel more in control. When I open my eyes, we\u2019re ascending, Tairn\u2019s wings beatin g with so much force that I slide back in the saddle with every push. He\u2019s left the ice-wielding First Wing cadet in a dive behind us, and I cringe as the dragon barely controls the descent, banking in the opposite direction we\u2019re headed. \u201cThat\u2019 s wher e they\u2019r e guar ding the egg.\u201d It has to be, considering another three dragons have taken the place of the others at the edge of the cliff, ready to launch. \u201cAgr eed.",
  "Hold tight.\u201d Tairn barely has a second to shout before a dragon flies out of the valley to the right and blasts a stream of fire at us. \u201cTairn!\u201d I scream, watching in horror as the flames barrel toward us. Tairn banks, taking the blast straight to his belly , shielding me from all but the sizzling heat that blazes by .",
  "What the actual fuck? \u201cAndarna?\u201d If something happens to her because First Wing is out for blood\u2026 \u201cFireproof, r emember?\u201d I let out a shaky breath. One worry down, but the other dragon is on our heels, opening its mouth and curling its tongue. Tairn jerks and his tail swings, catching the offending dragon in the side, just below its wing. The other dragon roars, falling sideways, losing altitude at an alarming rate. But I don\u2019t focus on the descent. Instead, I use the time to scan themountainside for the outpost I spied earlier . My heartbeat quickens as I spot it peeking out from a ridge, only one remaining dragon guarding it. \u201cXaden! The egg is her e!\u201d I relay . \u201cAlready on my way. We\u2019re twenty miles out.\u201d The edge of panic lacing his tone puts a knot of fear in my throat, which only grows when I see Deigh and Liam locked in battle above us with a familiar Orange Scorpiontail\u2014Baide. Jack.",
  "\u201cWe have to help Liam.\u201d \u201cOn it.\u201d Tairn accelerates and Andarna falls away . Once I see her tuck into the mountai nside where she\u2019ll be safe, I hunker down on Tairn\u2019s neck, giving him less wind resistance to fight as we climb faster than ever before. Wind yanks at the halo braid of my hair, the loosened strands whipping at my face as I keep my eyes locked on Deigh and Liam. Baide snaps her tail at Deigh, the venomous bulb perilously close to Deigh\u2019 s throat. \u201cHis scales are thicker than you think. It\u2019s Liam who\u2019s in dang er,\u201d Tairn warns, climbing higher . We\u2019re almost there when Jack unsheathes his sword and jumps from Baide\u2019 s back to Deigh\u2019 s, catching Liam by surprise as the dragons grapple close to the tower we\u2019re approaching at breakneck speed. There\u2019 s barely time for Liam to gain his feet before Jack thrusts the sword through his side. \u201cLiam!\u201d The scream tears from my throat as Jack kicks his boot into Liam\u2019 s stomach, forcing Liam\u2019 s body of f the blade\u2026and Deigh. No. No. No.",
  "Liam falls, his arms flailing as he plummets ahead of us. \u201cCatch him!\u201d I demand, afraid we won\u2019 t make it. Deigh and Baid e collide with the tower , and I glimpse Jack rolling to safety on the highest turret, his sadistic grin wide enough to see from hereas Tairn changes course with a dramatic right roll. Only the leathe r straps across my thighs keep me seated as we chase Liam\u2019 s tumbling body , Tairn\u2019s wings tucked in tight, but the outcroppings are too close, and we\u2019re too high.",
  "No. My throat closes. I refuse to lose him. Not when he\u2019s dedicated so many months of his life to keeping me alive. Failing isn\u2019t an option. It\u2019s just\u2026not. \u201cAndarna?\u201d I cry, already throwing open the window in my mind to where her glittering gift lies in wait. \u201cDo it,\u201d she answers. \u201cFocus on everything except you and T airn!\u201d She\u2019s right. There\u2019 s no point in me catching up to Liam if T airn is frozen. \u201cDo it!\u201d I reach for the golden power and my back arches as it barrels down my spine, flooding through my fingers and toes, enveloping every cell in my body before blasting outward in a shock wave that passes over T airn. Suddenly , we\u2019re the only ones moving, plunging through a windless sky toward Liam\u2019s frozen body , mere feet from the rugged outcropping of rocks below . Heartbeats, that\u2019s all we have.",
  "My entire body trembles with the effort to hold it, the power flowing from Andarna ebbing as Tairn extends his wings and claw, snatching Liam\u2019 s body from midair and taking out the rocks with the force of his tail as we barely escape death ourselves. \u201cGot him.\u201d Time snaps back, wind blasting me in the face as we climb, turning tightly to avoid colliding with the ridgeline. \u201cAndarna?\u201d \u201cSafe.\u201d Her voice is barely a whisper in my head. Wrath and fury boil my blood as my eyes lock onto the figure on top of that tower . This is the last time this asshole will come after my friends or me.Feirge appears from below , Rhiannon\u2019 s arms outstretched as they rise beneath us. Tairn slows just enough to transfer Liam to her.",
  "He\u2019s alive\u2014he has to be. It\u2019 s the only outcome I\u2019ll accept. In my peripherals, I see Cath and other dragons arrive from the north just as another squad launches from the clif f above. Baide is airborne behind us, racing toward her asshole of a rider, who is still gloating on the top of that fucking tower . \u201cClimb!\u201d I order , unsheathing a blade at my ribs and leaving one hand free to unsnap the buckles when it\u2019 s time. \u201cYou will not unseat yourself!\u201d Tairn bellows at me as we surge forward, leaving the smaller orange dragon behind us. He swivels his head left, blasting a stream of fire toward the line of First Wing dragons to warn them off and succeeding as we barrel past. A growing power sizzles in my chest as I lock my gaze on Jack. I can see the sick pleasure on his face as we fly closer , the blood that drips from his sword. Liam\u2019 s blood. An enormous dragon appears on the horizon.",
  "I don\u2019t need to look or even open my feeling s to know it\u2019s Xaden, but I can\u2019t spare a moment for him. Tairn is climbing faster than we\u2019ve ever climbed, and power is racing along my skin, scorching my blood. If this is it, if my power is backlashing, then I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t take that asshole with me. T airn is fireproof\u2014but not Jack.",
  "\u201cFaster!\u201d I shout, my voice desperate with worry we won\u2019 t make it in time. Tairn charges the tower , his wings beating faster and faster , and I instinctually throw my hands forward, as though I can project all this power lashing within me toward the enemy who just tried to kill my friend, who has done his best to kill me at every opportunity . That sizzle of magic grows to a lethal, swirling vortex of energy, and though my feet are still firmly grounded, the power rises to a breaking pointand the roof of my Archives disintegrates. Power crackles above me, swirls around me, wraps along my feet below me. I am the sky and the power of every storm that has ever been. I am infinite. A scream rips from my throat just as lightning splits the sky with a terrifying crack of thunder . The bluish streak of silver death slams into the tower , and sparks flare as it explodes in a blast of stone. Tairn banks to avoid the blast, and I pivot in the saddle. Jack falls down the mountainside in an avalanche of rock that I know he can\u2019t survive. From the way Baide cries beneath us, she knows it, too.",
  "My hand trembles as I sheathe the clean dagger at my ribs. The only blood to be found is on the rocks below , though I look at my hands as though they should be covered in death. Tairn roars with the unmistakable sound of pride. \u201cLightning wielder .\u201dThe death of a cadet is an inevitable yet acceptable tragedy . This process thins the herd, leaving only the str ongest riders, and as long as the cause of death does not br eak the Codex, any rider involved in extinguishing another \u2019s life shall not be punished. \u2014M AJOR AFENDRA \u2019S GUIDE TO THE RIDERS QUADRANT (UNAUTHORIZED EDITION ) CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE We land in the flight field what feels like minutes later . Or maybe it\u2019 s been a lifetime. I\u2019m not sure. The ground shakes as dragons arrive to the left and right, the field quickly filling with celebrating riders from Fourth Wing and angry ones from First. The dragons take off as soon as their riders dismount, with the exception of Andarna, who waits between T airn\u2019s forelegs as I fumble with the buckles. Jack is dead. I killed him. I\u2019m the reason his parents will get a letter , the reason his name will be etched into stone.",
  "Across the field, Garrick lifts the crystal egg above his head as Dain waves the flag, and those in Fourth Wing cheer , rushing toward the pair like they\u2019re gods. Tairn\u2019s weight shifts beneath me as the last buckle slips through my fingers, and I slide out of the saddle. My head swims, stress no doubt bringing on the dizzy spell that makes it hard to keep my balance as I make my way to his shoulder and dismount. I stumble in the mud, hitting my knees when I reach where Andarna liesbetween T airn\u2019s forelegs, clearly exhausted. \u201cTell me Liam is alive. T ell me it was worth it.\u201d \u201cDeigh says that he lives. The swor d went thr ough his side,\u201d Tairn says. \u201cGood. Good. That\u2019 s good. Thank you, Andarna. I know how much that cost you.\u201d I look up into her golden eyes, and she blinks slowly back. \u201cWorth it.\u201d Nausea holds me in its grip, and my mouth waters.",
  "Killed him. I killed him. \u201cDamn, Sorrengail!\u201d Sawyer calls out. \u201cLightning? You\u2019ve been holding out on us!\u201d Lightning I used to take a life. My stom ach heaves and a dark shadow envelops me, but it\u2019s not Xaden. Tairn has folded his wings over us, closing out the world while I retch up everything I\u2019ve eaten today . \u201cYou did what was necessary ,\u201d Tairn says, but it doesn\u2019 t stop my stomach from clenching and tightening again, trying its best to force up what\u2019 s not even there. \u201cYou saved your friend,\u201d Andarna adds. Finally , my stomach settles, and I force myself to my feet, dragging the back of my hand over my mouth. \u201cY ou need to get some rest, don\u2019 t you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud you\u2019r e mine.\u201d Andarna\u2019 s voice wavers, the blinks of her eyes becoming slower . \u201cEven if I need a bath.\u201d Tairn draws back his wings, and Andarna walks forward, then launches into the sky with steady wingbeats toward the V ale. I stare up at the saddle. I need to get him out of this so he can rest, too.",
  "But all I can think is that I finally have a signet, a real, true signet, and the first thing I did with it was kill a man. \u201cViolet?\u201d Dain appears on my left. \u201cThat was you with the lightning strike? The one that took down the tower?\u201d The one that killed Jack.I nod, thinking of all the times I aimed for the shoulder instead of the heart. The poisons I used to incapacitate, not murder . I left Oren unconscious on the ground at Threshing and didn\u2019 t even go for the throat when he invaded my room. All because I didn\u2019 t want to be a killer . \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019 s been a lightning wielder in more than a century\u2014\u201d He pauses. \u201cV iolet?\u201d \u201cI killed him,\u201d I whisper , studying the central chest plate of the saddle. That has to be where everythin g connects, right? He has to get out of this thing somehow . Mom will be so proud to know I\u2019m just like the others now. Just like her.",
  "My empty belly turns over again , and I retch like my body is trying to expel the guilt. \u201cShit.\u201d He rubs his hand over my back. \u201cIt\u2019 s all right, V i.\u201d It stops sooner this time, and Dain pulls me against his chest, rocking gently as his hand makes soothing motions up and down my spine. \u201cI killed him.\u201d Why the hell is that all I can say? I\u2019m a broken music box, repeating the same melody over and over, and everyone can see me. Everyone knows I can\u2019 t handle the consequences of my own signet. \u201cI know . I know .\u201d He presses a kiss to the top of my head. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t want to use that kind of power again, you don\u2019 t have to\u2014\u201d \u201cGet the fuck away from her with that nonsense.\u201d Xaden pushes Dain\u2019 s chest and tugs me out of his arms, then grips my shoulders, turning me to face him. \u201cY ou killed Barlowe.\u201d I nod. \u201cLightning. Your signet is lightning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He looks at me with such intensity , as though my answer is the key to whatever he needs. \u201cYes.\u201d His jaw flexes and his head bobs once. \u201cI thought so, but I wasn\u2019 t sure until I saw you take that tower down.\u201dHe thought so?",
  "What the hell does that even mean?",
  "\u201cListen to me, Sorrengail.\u201d He lifts one hand to stroke loose tendrils of hair behind my ear, his touch surprisingly gentle.",
  "\u201cThe world is a better place without Barlowe in it. We both know that. Do I wish I\u2019d been the one to end his miser able life? Absolutely . But what you did will save countless others. He was nothing more than a bully and was only going to get worse as he grew more powerful. His dragon will choose another rider when she\u2019s ready . I\u2019m glad he\u2019 s dead. I am glad you killed him.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019 t mean to.\u201d It\u2019s barely a whisper . \u201cI was just so fucking mad, and we\u2019d just caught Liam. I thoug ht my relic was backlashing finally .\u201d My eyes widen. \u201cIt was close, Xaden. It was too close. I had to do something.\u201d \u201cWhatever you did is what kept him alive.\u201d His thumb strokes over my cheek, the motion completely at odds with his tone, and his eyes flare just enough that I know he\u2019 s aware of what I did. \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d I blurt. \u201cRhiannon can move objects through space, and Dain has retrocognition\u2014\u201d \u201cHey ,\u201d Dain snaps. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019 t know that already?\u201d Xaden barks over his shoulder . \u201cKaori can bring his imaginati on to life, and Sawyer can bend metal. Mira can extend the wards.",
  "Everyone has a signet that isn\u2019t just useful for battle. They\u2019re tools for good in the world. And what the hell am I, Xaden? I\u2019m a fucking weapon .\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to use your power , Vi,\u201d Dain starts, his voice soft and comforting. \u201cStop. Fucking. Coddling. Her.\u201d Xaden bites out every word at Dain. \u201cShe is not a child. She\u2019s a full-grown woman. A rider. Start treating her like one and at least have the decency to give her the truth . You think Melgren or any other general\u2014to include her own mother\u2014is going to let her sit on a power like this? It\u2019s not like she can hide it, not the way she just demolished one of the practice forts.\u201d\u201cYou just want her to be like you,\u201d Dain argues. \u201cA cold-blooded killer . Soon you\u2019ll be telling her that it\u2019 s all right, you get used to the killing.\u201d I inhale a sharp breath. Xaden nails him with a glare. \u201cThe blood in my veins is as warm as yours, Aetos, and if it\u2019s my job you want next year, then you\u2019d better start understanding that you never get used to killing, but you do understand that it\u2019s necessary .\u201d He turns back to me, his dark gaze boring into mine.",
  "\u201cThis isn\u2019t primary school. This is war\u2014and you heard me say it once before, but the ugly truth those not on the front lines choose to forget is there are always body bags in war .\u201d I start to shake my head, but his eyes narrow on mine. \u201cYou might not like it, might even loathe it, but it\u2019 s power like yours that saves lives.\u201d \u201cBy killing people?\u201d I cry. If Sgaeyl is right, and signets reflect who we are at our core, then I\u2019m exactly as Xaden nicknamed me\u2026V iolence. \u201cBy defeating invading armies before they get the chance to hurt civilians. You want to keep Rhiannon\u2019 s nephew alive in that little border village? This is how. You want to keep Mira alive when she\u2019s behind enemy lines? This. Is. How . You are not just a weapon, Sorrengail. You are the weapon. You train this ability , own it, and you\u2019ll have the power to defend an entire kingdom .\u201d He smooths back more wind-loosened tendrils of my hair behind my ears, clearing my vision so I have no excuse but to see the honesty in his eyes.",
  "When he\u2019s sure I\u2019m not going to argue furth er, he looks to his side. \u201cRhiannon, can you get her back to the citadel?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely .\u201d Rhiannon hustles over . Dain scof fs and walks toward the other squad leaders, leaving us. \u201cThe saddle\u2014\u201d I start. \u201cTairn can get it off himself. It was one of his many design stipulations.\u201d Xaden turns to leave but pauses. \u201cThank you for saving Liam. He\u2019s important to me.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019 t have to thank\u2026\u201d I sigh at his back. \u201cAnd he\u2019 s already gone.\u201d\u201cYou two have the weirdest relationship,\u201d Rhiannon says, linking her arm with mine. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a relationship.\u201d I look up at Tairn, who\u2019 s surprisingly held his tongue through whatever that was with Xaden and Dain. \u201cGo,\u201d Tairn ur ges. \u201cBut do not wallow in guilt, Silver One. Whatever you feel is natural. Allow yourself to feel it but then let it go. The wingleader made a valid point. With a signet like that, you are the best hope the kingdom has against the hordes of evil that seek to harm it.",
  "Rest and I will see you tomorr ow. I\u2019ll get my own saddle off.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re most definitely in a relationship,\u201d Rhiannon continues, tugging me off the field. \u201cI just can\u2019t figure out if it\u2019s the opposites-attract partnership that has you two baring claws or the slow, lethal burn of scalding sexual tension.\u201d She glances sideways at me. \u201cNow tell me how the hell you two moved that fast out there.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhen Liam was falling, Feirge and I flew as fast as we could, but I knew we\u2019d be too slow given our angle and speed, and I thought you\u2026\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cIt just looked like you were high above him one second and had him in the next.",
  "I\u2019ve never seen a dragon fly that fast. It\u2019s like I blinked and missed it.\u201d Now guilt bites into me for a whole other reason. Rhiannon is my friend, my closest one here, if I\u2019m being honest about what Dain and I have become. Of everyone, she should know\u2014 \u201cDo not feel guilt that you cannot tell her. This secret belongs to dragonkind, not you,\u201d Tairn warns. \u201cNo one has the right to risk our hatchlings. Not even you, Silver One.\u201d \u201cTairn is really fast,\u201d I say in way of explanation. It\u2019s not a lie, but it isn\u2019t the full truth, either . \u201cAnd thank gods for it. Zihnal must really love Liam, cheating death twice today .\u201dBut it wasn\u2019 t Liam who cheated death. It was me.",
  "And I can\u2019t help but wonder if somewhere, on some plane of existence, Malek sits on his throne, angry that I stole a soul from his grasp. But then again, I gave him Jack\u2019 s. Of course, it might have broken mine forever . \u2026 The wooden target in my room wobbles as one of my daggers sinks into the wood beside the last one I threw . I might be angry with the world, but at least my aim isn\u2019t off. If I miss, there\u2019 s a good chance the blade is flying out the window , considering where I have the tar get propped up on the wall. I throw three more, rapid-fire, and hit the throat of the person-shaped target every single time. What\u2019 s the point of going for shoulders anymore if I\u2019m already taking people out with bolts of lightnin g? What was my restraint for?",
  "With a flick of my wrist, I send the next dagger soaring, putting it straight through the figure\u2019 s forehead just as there\u2019 s a knock at my door . It\u2019s either Rhiannon asking for the tenth time if I want to talk about what happened today or it\u2019 s Liam\u2014 I pause. It can\u2019t be Liam, checking to see if I\u2019m actually turned in for the night, because Liam is still in the infirmary , healing from the sword he took to the side. \u201cCome in.\u201d Who cares if I\u2019m in nothing but my dressing gown ? It\u2019s not like I can\u2019 t strike an intruder dead with a knife.",
  "Or lightning. The door opens beside me, but I don\u2019t bother looking as I throw another dagger . That height? That hint of dark hair I catch in my periph eral vision? That incredible scent? I don\u2019t even need to look fully\u2014my body tells me it\u2019s Xaden. Then my body reminds me exactly what it feels like to have his mouth onmine, and my stomach flutters. Shit, I\u2019m too on edge to deal with him or the way he makes me feel tonight. \u201cImagining that\u2019s me?\u201d he asks, shutting my door and leaning back against it, folding his arms across his chest. Then he does a double-take, his heated gaze roaming over my body . Suddenly , the spring breeze coming through the open window isn\u2019t enough to cool my skin, not when he\u2019 s looking at me like that. My long braid swings across my back as I take another dagg er off my dresser .",
  "\u201cNo. But it was you about twenty minutes ago.\u201d \u201cWho is it now?\u201d He raises a brow , crosses one ankle over the other . \u201cNo one you know .\u201d With a flick of my wrist, the next blade goes through the sternum. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I glance his way just long enough to note that he\u2019s bathed and wearing our standard uniform instead of flight leathers, and definitely not long enough to note how fucking good he looks. Just once, I\u2019d love to see him disheveled or unnerved, anything outside that calm control he wears like armor. \u201cLet me guess. Since Liam is out of commission, it\u2019 s your duty to lecture me about sleeping in plain cotton.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019 t come to lecture you,\u201d he says softly , and I can feel the warmth of his gaze like a caress as it rakes over the thin black straps of my dressing gown. \u201cBut I can definitely see that you\u2019re not wearing your armor .\u201d \u201cNo one is going to be ridicu lous enough to attack me now.\u201d I take another dagger from the dresser , my pile dwindling. \u201cNot when I can kill them from fifty yards away .\u201d Tapping the end of the razor -sharp weapon, I pivot slightly , just enough to face him. \u201cDo you think it works inside?",
  "I mean, how does someone wield lightning if there\u2019 s no sky?\u201d Keeping my eyes locked on his, I fling the dagger at the target.",
  "The satisfyi ng sound of split wood tells me I hit true. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s hotter than it should be.\u201d He pulls in a deep breath. \u201cI think that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to figure out.\u201d His gaze drops to my mouth and his arms tense.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to step in and say you can train me? You can save me?\u201d I click my tongue and have the absolutely ridiculous urge to run it up the lines of the relic on his neck, tracing the intricate pattern. \u201c How very un-Xaden of you. \u201d \u201c I have no clue how to train a lightning wielder , and from what I witnessed today , you don \u2019 t need saving. \u201d There \u2019 s pure longing in his eyes as he scans the length of my body from my bare toes to the hemlin e that skirts my thighs , over my breasts to my neck , finally reaching my eyes . \u201cOnly from myself,\u201d I mutter .",
  "The things I think about doing to him when he looks at me like that would surely ruin me, and tonight I\u2019m not sure I care. That\u2019 s a dangerous combination. \u201cSo then why are you here, Xaden?\u201d \u201cBecause I can\u2019t seem to stay away .\u201d He sounds anything but pleased by the admission, but my breath catches anyway . \u201cShouldn\u2019 t you be out there celebrating?\u201d Everyone else is. \u201cWe won a battle, not a war.\u201d He pushes off the door and takes a single step, closing the distance betw een us, and lifts my braid from over my shoulder , slowly rubbing his thumb along the strands. \u201cAnd I figured you might still be upset.\u201d \u201cYou told me to get over myself , remember? So why the fuck would you care if I\u2019m upset?\u201d I fold my arms across my chest, choosing anger over lust. \u201cI told you that you\u2019d have to develop a stomach for killing. I never said you\u2019d get over it.\u201d He drops my braid. \u201cI should, though, right?\u201d I shake my head and retreat into the center of the room. \u201cWe spend three years here learning how to become killers, promoting and praising those who do it best.\u201d He doesn\u2019 t even flinch, just watches me in that observant, infuriatingly calm way of his. \u201cI\u2019m not mad that Jack is dead .",
  "We both know he\u2019s wanted to kill me since Parapet, and eventually he would have. I\u2019m mad that him dyingchanges me.\u201d I tap my chest right above my heart. \u201cDain told me that this place strips away the niceties to reveal who someone really is.\u201d \u201cNot going to ar gue there.\u201d He watches me as I begin to pace. \u201cAnd I just keep thinking that when I was younger , I asked my dad what would happen if I wanted to be a rider like Mom or Brennan, and he told me that I wasn\u2019 t like them. That my path was dif ferent, except this place has peeled away my civility , my niceties, and it turns out my power is more destructive than any of theirs.\u201d I stop right in front of him and hold up my hands. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like I can blame this power on Tairn, not that I would. Signets are based on the rider, just fueled by the dragon, which means this has always been there under the surface, just waiting to be unleashed. And to think\u2014\u201d A knot forms in my throat. \u201cAll this time, I had this tiny, driving hope that I would be like Brennan, and that would be the twist in my little fable. That my signet would be mending, and I could put all the broken things back together .",
  "But instead, I\u2019m made to split them apart.",
  "How many people will I kill with this?\u201d His eyes soften. \u201cAs many as you choose. Just because you gained power today doesn\u2019 t mean you lost agency .\u201d \u201cWhat is wrong with me?\u201d I shake my head, my hands clenching into fists. \u201cAny other rider would be thrilled.\u201d Even now, I feel the power simmering just beneath my skin. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been like any other rider.\u201d He moves closer but doesn\u2019 t touch me. \u201cProbably because you never wanted to be here.\u201d Gods, I want him to touch me, to wipe away the ugliness of the day, to make me feel something\u201a anything but this welling shame. \u201cNone of you wanted to be here.\u201d I glance pointedly at the rebellion relic on his neck. \u201cY ou\u2019re all doing just fine.\u201d He looks at me, really looks , and it feels like he sees entire ly too much. \u201cMost of us would burn this place to the ground if we had the option, but every marked one wants to be here because it\u2019s our only path for survival.It\u2019s not the same for you. You wanted a quiet life full of books and facts. You wanted to record the battle s, not be in them. There is nothing wrong with you. You get to be angry that you killed a man today . You get to be angry that man tried to kill your friend.",
  "You get to feel howev er you want within these walls.\u201d He\u2019s close enough now that I can feel his body heat through the thin cotton of my dressing gown. \u201cBut not outside them.\u201d It\u2019 s not a question. \u201cWe\u2019re riders,\u201d he says, as if that\u2019s explanation enough. He takes hold of my hands and brings them to his chest. \u201cSo do whatever you need to get it out. You want to yell? Yell at me. You want to hit something? Hit me. I can take it.\u201d Hitting him is the last thing I want to do, and suddenly , I\u2019m done fighting it. \u201cCome on,\u201d he whispers. \u201cShow me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d I surge up on my toes and kiss him.Though not forbidden, cadets ar e strongly encouraged not to develop str ong r omantic attachments while studying in the quadrant for the efficiency of the unit. \u2014A RTICLE FIVE, SECTION SEVEN THE DRAGON RIDER\u2019S CODEX CHAPTER THIRTY His body goes rigid for one beat, two, and then he spins us impossibly fast, putting my back against the door, jostling the frame.

I want to replace the anger with lust, the death of the day with the pulse-pounding assurance of my own life, and I know he\u2019s capable of delive ring all that and more. \u201cYou said to do whatever I need.\u201d I arch my back, pressing the tips of my breasts against his chest. His breathing changes, and there\u2019 s a war in his eyes that I\u2019m determined to win. It\u2019s time to stop dancing around this unbearable tension and break it.",
  "He leans down, his mouth only inches from mine. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m the last thing you need.\u201d The barely leashed growl of his voice rumbles up through his chest, and every nerve ending in my body flares to life. \u201cAre you suggesting someone else?\u201d My heart races as I chance callinghis bluf f. \u201cFuck no.\u201d The unmistakable flare of jealousy narrows his eyes for a heartbeat before his hips pin mine to the door, and my instant relief at his answer is replaced by a jolt of pure lust. I can see that infamous control of his hovering on the edge, balanc ing precariously on the point of a knife. All he needs is one. Little. Push. And I\u2019m about to shamelessly shove. \u201cGood.\u201d I tilt my head up to his and draw his bottom lip between mine, sucking before gently nipping him with my teeth. \u201cBecause I only want you, Xaden.\u201d The words breach something within him, and he gives. Finally .",
  "Our mouths collide, and the kiss is hot and hard and completely out of our control. Need streaks down my spine as he takes my ass in his hands and hauls me against his hips, my back raking the ridges of the door behind me as I use it as leverage to push closer to his strength. I wrap my legs around his waist and lock my ankles. My dressing gown rises with the motion, but I don\u2019t care, not with the all-consumi ng way he\u2019s kissing me. The caress of his mouth and the strokes of his wicked tongue steal every logic al thought, and my world narrows to this kiss, this minute, this man. Mine. In this moment, Xaden Riorson is mine. Or maybe I\u2019m his. Who fucking cares as long as he keeps kissing me? Heat floods my body in an addictive rush, setting every inch of my skin aflame as his mouth slides down my neck in a sensual assault that makes me moan. \u201cGods,\u201d he says against my throat, and then we\u2019re moving. Wood scrapes the floor and crashes before my ass hits the desk, and my ankles fall from the small of his back when he leans over me, spearing his fingers through my hair at the nape of my neck as he takes my mouth again. I kiss him back with a hunger I\u2019ve only known with him.",
  "My hands fly back to brace my weight, knocking anything and everythingout of my way, sending whatever careening to the floor . The clock stops ticking.",
  "\u201cYou\u2019ll hate me in the morning. You. Don\u2019 t. Really . Want. This.\u201d He punctuates each word with a kiss along my jaw, making his way to my ear. He bites the lobe, and my core liquefies, going molten. \u201cStop telling me what I want.\u201d I breathe raggedly and thread my fingers through the short strands of his hair, tilt my head, giving him better access. He takes it, working his way down my neck to where it curves into my shoulder . Fuck, that feels good. Every touch of his mouth to my heated skin is flame to kindling, and I suck in a sharp breath when he lingers on a sensitive spot, taking his time. But then he stills again, his breath hot and wet against the side of my neck. My brow furrows with an unwelcome thought. \u201cUnless you don\u2019t want me.\u201d \u201cDoes this feel like I don\u2019t want you?\u201d He takes my hand and slides it between our bodies, and my fingers curl around his length through his leathers. I whimper with pure want at the feel of how hard he is for me. \u201cI always fucking want you.\u201d He groans as I squeeze. Then he lifts his head, seizes my gaze with his, and I recognize the wild need in those gold- flecked depths. It mirrors my own.",
  "\u201cYou walk into a room, and I can\u2019t look away . I get anywhere near you, and this is what happens. Instantly hard. Fucking hell, I can barely think when you\u2019re around.\u201d He rocks his hips into my hand, and my grip tightens along with my stomach. \u201cWantin g you is not the problem here.\u201d \u201cThen what is?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to do the honorable thing and not take advantage of you after you\u2019ve had a shit day .\u201d His jaw flexes. I smile and kiss the side of his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s always a shit day around here. And it\u2019s not taking advantage when I\u2019m asking\u201d\u2014my teeth nip at his lips\u2014\u201ccorrection, begging you to make my day better .\u201d \u201cViolet.\u201d He says my name like a warning, as if he\u2019s something I should be wary of. Violet. He only says my name when it\u2019s just the two of us, when all the walls and the pretenses fall away , and gods if I don\u2019t want to hear it again and again, just like that. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think, Xaden. I just want to feel.\u201d I release him.",
  "One tug of the ribbon is all it takes to unravel the long, loose braid of my hair, and I run my fingers through the mass. His eyes darken, and I know I\u2019ve won. \u201cFuck me, this hair,\u201d he says, then hovers his mouth over mine. \u201cAnd this mouth . All I ever want to do is kiss you, even when you piss me of f.\u201d \u201cSo kiss me.\u201d I arch into him and claim his lips, kissing him like this might be the only time I\u2019ll get the chance. This kind of despe ration isn\u2019t natural; it\u2019 s a wildfire that\u2019 s likely to burn us both to the ground if we let it. The kiss is blata ntly, deliciously carnal, and I melt against him, matching every thrust of his tongue with mine. He tastes like mint, and Xaden, and I can\u2019t get enough. He\u2019s the worst kind of addiction, dangerous and impossible to sate. \u201cTell me to stop,\u201d he whispers, his thumb skimming the hype rsensitive skin of my inner thigh. \u201cDon\u2019 t stop.\u201d I\u2019ll die if he does. \u201cFuck, V iolet,\u201d he groans, slipping his hand between my thighs.",
  "Never mind. That is how I want him to say my name from now on. Just like that. He glides the fabric of my underwear across my clit, and my back arches at the burst of pleasure that radiates through my body , so sweet I can taste it. He captures my mouth with his again in a hungry assault, his tongue sliding against mine as his fingers stroke me through the fabric, expertly using it for friction. I try to rock my hips against his hand for more, but myfeet dangle off the desk, robbin g me of leverage. I can only have what he decides to give. \u201cTouch me,\u201d I demand, my fingernails biting into the back of his strong neck, desire pounding through me like a drumbeat. His voice is ragged against my mouth. \u201cIf I get my hands on you, really , honestly get my hands on you, I don\u2019 t know if I\u2019ll be able to stop.\u201d He would. I know it in my soul. That\u2019 s why I trust him with my body . My heart? It isn\u2019 t playing into this decision.",
  "\u201cStop being so fucking honorable and fuck me, Xaden.\u201d His eyes flare, and then he kisses me like I\u2019m the air he\u2019s been missing, like his life depends on it, and I think mine just might. His fingers slide under my underwear and strok e my slickened core, and a moan tumbles from my lips. His touch is electric. \u201cSo damned soft.\u201d He kisses me deeply as his fingers touch and tease, making that sweet coil of pleasure tighten in my core. I dig my nails into his shoulder , my back arching as he makes tighter and tighter circles against my swollen clit. \u201cI bet you taste just as good as you feel.\u201d Pleasure shudders through me, a living, breathing fire beneath my skin. \u201cMore.\u201d It\u2019s all I\u2019m capable of saying, demanding, as my skin flushes and my pulse skyrockets. I\u2019m going to combust, to burst into flames, and all I can do is whimper against his mouth as he slides one finger inside me. My muscles clench around him, and he works in a second. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking hot.\u201d His voice drops, sounding like it\u2019s been scraped over coals. \u201cIt might damn us both, but I can\u2019t wait to feel you come around my cock.\u201d \u201cOh gods. \u201d That mouth .",
  "I throw my hands back against the wall for leverage, knocki ng something loose as my hips roll. Something shatters on the floor to the left as I ride his thrusting fingers. He curls them against my inner walls and I gasp, my thigh s locking around his leather -clad hips. And when he uses his thumb to stroke my clit, the friction and pressu re push meto the edge of mindless bliss. I cry out, and he covers the sound with his mouth, kissing with devious strokes of his tongue that match the movement of his fingers within me. Power surges, rippling through my bones, and I grab onto Xaden even harder , surprised at the unexpected rush of crackling ener gy.",
  "\u201cLook at you. You\u2019re fucking beautiful, Violet. Let go for me.\u201d His words curl around my mind, his mouth fused to mine, and the intimacy of it pushes me to the limit of pleasure and then right over it. He swallows my cry as my back bows, the first wave of my orgasm washing over me, releasing that tight coil of tension in a burst of sparks at the edge of my vision, breaking me into a million scattered stars. Lightning strikes outside my window , flashing light through the room again and again as he strokes me with an expertise that kicks the first climax into a second. \u201cXaden,\u201d I moan as the pleasure ebbs and flares again. He grins and slides his fingers from my body , and I\u2019m nothing but ragged breaths and raw hunger as I reach for his shirt.",
  "I want it off now. He accommodates my urgency , ripping off the fabric, and then we\u2019re kissing again, all swirling tongues and roaming hands. The feel of his skin under my fingertips is divine, impossibly soft over yards of hard muscle. I trace the lines of his back, memorizing the dips and hollows as sinew ripples with every move he makes. \u201cI need you now,\u201d I gasp and reach for the buttons of his leathers. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d he asks as I shove the fabric\u2014 and any cloth beneath\u2014past his hips, freeing the thick length of his cock. It\u2019s hot and hard in my hand, and the moan that rips from his lips makes me feel invincible. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to fuck me.\u201d I arch up and kiss him. He groans, dragging my hips to the edge of the desk, then working my underwear down my legs, leaving me bare. My pulse skyrockets. \u201cI take the fertility suppressant.\u201d Of course, weboth do. The last thing anyone wants are little quadrant babies running around.",
  "But it\u2019 s better said than sorry . \u201cSame.\u201d He grips my hips, lifting me for a better angle, and the head of his cock rubs against my clit. I gasp and his eyes lock with mine. The hunger I see etched in every tense line of his body is my undoing. I don\u2019t care if it damns us. I need him. No more holding back. Not anymore. I reach between us, guiding the head of his cock to my entrance , but this position is shit. He\u2019s considerably taller than the desk, and if I wasn\u2019 t so desperate for him, I\u2019d laugh, but I am. I arch, but it doesn\u2019 t help.",
  "Every second we wait feels like it stretches on for a decade. \u201cFucking desk,\u201d he swears. My thoughts exactly . His biceps flex as he lifts me by the backs of my thighs, and I wrap my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist, my dressing gown caught between us as he pivots. Our mouths meet in a ravenous kiss as my back hits the armoire, but I barely blink, too consumed with the stroke of his tongue, the feel of him between my thighs. \u201cShit. Are you all right?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Y ou won\u2019 t break me.\u201d He push es inside that first, tight inch of me, and I gasp at the fit, the stretch. \u201cMor e.\u201d I\u2019m too busy kissing him to speak. \u201cI need all of you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me, Violet.\u201d Whatever \u2019s left of his control slips, and he takes me completely with one hard thrust. I moan into the kiss. Deep . He\u2019s so fucking deep that I feel him everywher e. \u201cTell me you\u2019r e all right.\u201d He\u2019s already moving, thank gods.",
  "\u201cI\u2019m perfect.\u201d Better than perfect. Power blazes beneath my skin again, buzzing in wordless, frenzied demand.\u201cYou feel so fucking good.\u201d He slam s back into me, again and again, as he sets a brutal, steady pace, his mouth sliding down my neck as his hand rises to cup my breast. I can\u2019t even think around the maddening pleasure as my back pounds the armoire door with every thrust, filling the room with the sound of our straining bodies and creaking wood. Every stroke is better than the last. My breaths stutter . \u201cFuck, I\u2019m never going to get enough of you, am I?\u201d he says, his face buried in my neck as I arch into him. \u201cShut up and fuck me, Riorson.\u201d Tomorrow is soon enough for regrets. Reaching up, I grasp the top edge of the armoire with one hand so I can rock back with more force, meeting the drive of his hips, taking him deeper , harder . He drags one of my nightgown\u2019 s straps off my should er, and the cool night air kisses the hardene d peak of my nipple a heartbeat before his hot mouth covers it. The sensat ions spiral, spinning and coiling, forming a tight knot of pleasure so deep within me, the tension is sublimely unbearable.",
  "The armoire door groans, then splinters off the hinges, and Xaden\u2019 s shadows whip out, protecting me as the frame snaps and wood crashes around us. My power flares, rising in answer to his, sizzling beneath my skin as I grab ahold of his shoulders, my mouth finding his. There\u2019 s no stopping. W e can\u2019t stop. \u201cFuck,\u201d he curses as he takes me over and over, never stoppin g, turning us again so there\u2019 s cloth against my back. But it\u2019s not the bed. It\u2019s the curtains shoved to the side of the window .",
  "Energy crackles again as our mouths meet, and still he drives on, winding that knot inside me painfully tighter with every movement. And the power\u2026it\u2019 s too much. It\u2019s burning me, heating my blood with the need for release. \u201cXaden,\u201d I cry out, simultaneously writhing yet holding on to him like he\u2019 s the only thing anchoring me to the earth.\u201cI\u2019ve got you, Violet,\u201d he promises, his breath ragged pants against my lips. \u201cLet it out.\u201d Lightning whips through me, flashing so bright that my eyes slam shut. Heat flares above me as thunder cracks immediately . And I smell smoke. \u201cShit.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s power fills the room, eclipsing what light we had, and the curtain falls, but we\u2019re moving before the charred fabric can so much as touch my skin. That knot of pleasure builds to a breaking point as he takes me to the floor , and finally , I have all of his weight as he drives into me. Shadows fall away and the sight of him above me, his dark gaze locked on mine in intense concentration, is the most beautiful sight I\u2019ve ever seen.",
  "\u201cSo. V ery. Beautiful.\u201d I punctate each word with a kiss. He draw s back, his eyes searchi ng mine for a heartbeat or two before he devastates me with another kiss that has me straining for more, rocking my hips against his. This man kisses with his whole body , rolling his hips in time with the thrust of his tongue, bracing just enough of his weight so I can breathe while stroking his chest over my hypersensitive nipples. He keeps me on the same edge he\u2019s riding, and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take it before I set this entire room on fire. \u201cI need\u2026I need\u2026\u201d My frantic eyes search his. Where are my words?",
  "\u201cI know .\u201d He claims my mouth again and reaches between us, using those talented fingers to stroke me into another orgasm, and light flashes again, followed by thunder and darkness as I come apart under him. Pleasure takes me in waves, rolling through me again and again until all I can do is clutch Xaden\u2019 s shoulders and ride it out in blissful surrender . \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he whispers. The second I come down, his rhythm breaks, and he presses my knee up toward my chest and takes me even deeper . I rock my hips up to meet his,sweat beading on our skin as I watch him unravel with rapt fascination. I love his loss of control just as much as I fear my own, and when I swirl my hips, he groans, arching his neck as he thrusts once. T wice.",
  "On the third, he shouts, then shudders within me, and his power lashes out in streaks of shadows, the force splitting the wooden target on the other side of the window . Pieces fly and Xaden throws out another wave of darkness that lasts just long enough to shield us from the debris. Then the shadows retreat and daggers clatter to the ground behind me. He looks as shocked, and as enthralled, as I feel as we lay there, staring at each other , our chests heaving in the aftermath of what can only be described as complete and utter madness. \u201cI\u2019ve never lost control like that,\u201d he says, bracing his weight on one arm and brushing my hair back from my face with the other . The move is so gentle, so at odds with what we\u2019ve just experienced, that I can\u2019t help but blink, then smile. \u201cMe neither .\u201d The smile morphs into a full-out grin. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve ever had power to lose control of before.\u201d He laughs and rolls us to his side, keeping me close and cushioning my head with his biceps.",
  "I snif f at the smoke in the air . \u201cDid I\u2026\u201d \u201cSet the curtains on fire?\u201d He lifts a brow . \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I can\u2019t find it in me to be embarrassed, so I brush the backs of my fingers across the stubble along his jaw . \u201cAnd you put it out.\u201d \u201cYes. Right before I destroyed your throwing target.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a new one.\u201d I glance over at the armoire. \u201cAnd we\u2026\u201d \u201cYep.\u201d He lifts his brows. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure you need a new chair , too.\u201d \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d I didn\u2019 t even get the man\u2019 s pants entirely off, and mydressing gown is haphazardly hanging from one shoulder . \u201cFrighteningly perfect.\u201d He cups the side of my face. \u201cWe shoul d get you cleaned up and to sleep. We can worry about\u2026your room tomorrow . Ironically , your bed is the only thing we didn\u2019 t wreck.\u201d I sit up to confirm that the bed made it, and Xaden does the same next to me, leaning forward. Immediately , I lose interest in everything but the muscled lines of his back and the navy-blue relic Sgaeyl transferred to him. I reach out and trace the dragon relic on his back, my fingers lingering on the raised silver scars, and he stiffens.",
  "They\u2019re all short, thin lines, too precise to be a whip, no rhyme or reason to their pattern but never intersecting. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I whisper , holding my breath. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to know .\u201d He\u2019s tense but doesn\u2019 t move away from my touch. \u201cI do.\u201d They don\u2019t look accidental. Someone hurt him deliberately , maliciously , and it makes me want to hunt the person down and do the same to them. His jaw flexes as he looks over his shoulder , and his eyes meet mine. I bite my lip, knowing this mom ent can go either way. He can shut me out like always or he can actually let me in. \u201cThere\u2019 s a lot of them,\u201d I murmur , dragging my fingers down his spine. \u201cA hundred and seven.\u201d He looks away . That number makes my stomach lurch, and then my hand pauses. A hundr ed and seven. That\u2019 s the number Liam mentioned.",
  "\u201cThat\u2019 s how many kids under the age of majority carry the rebellion relic.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d I shift so I can see his face. \u201cWhat happened, Xaden?\u201d He brushes my hair back, and the look that passes over his face is so close to tender that it makes my heart stutter . \u201cI saw the opportunity to make a deal,\u201d he says softly . \u201cAnd I took it.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of deal leaves you with scars like that?\u201dConflict rages in his eyes, but then he sighs. \u201cThe kind where I take personal respon sibility for the loyalty of the hundred and seven kids the rebellion\u2019 s leade rs left behind, and in return, we\u2019re allowed to fight for our lives in the Riders Quadrant instead of being put to death like our parents.\u201d He averts his gaze. \u201cI chose the chance of death over the certainty .\u201d The cruelty of the offer and the sacrifice he made to save the others hits like a physical blow . I cradle his cheek and guide his face back to mine. \u201cSo if any of them betray Navarre\u2026\u201d I lift my brows. \u201cThen my life is forfeit. The scars are a reminder .\u201d It\u2019s why Liam says he owes him everything. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.\u201d Especially when he wasn\u2019 t the one who led the rebellion.",
  "He looks at me like he sees into the very depths of who I am. \u201cYou have nothing to apologize for .\u201d I grab his hand as he moves to stand. \u201cStay .\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019 t.\u201d Two lines appear between his brows as he searches my eyes. \u201cPeople will talk.\u201d \u201cWhen did I ever give you the impression that I give a fuck what people think?\u201d I use his earlier words against him and sit up, curling my hand around the section of his neck that bears his relic. \u201cStay with me, Xaden. Don\u2019 t make me beg.\u201d \u201cWe both know this is a bad idea.\u201d \u201cThen it\u2019 s our bad idea.\u201d His shou lders dip, and I know I\u2019ve won. He\u2019s mine for the night . We take turns sneaking out long enough to clean up, and then he slides into bed behind me. \u201cOnly within these walls,\u201d he says quietly , and I understand what he means. \u201cOnly within these walls,\u201d I agree. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in a relationship or anything.",
  "That would be\u2026disastrous given the chain of comm and. \u201cWe\u2019re riders, after all.\u201d \u201cI just don\u2019 t trust my temper if anyone says\u2014\u201dI brush a kiss over his mouth, silencing him. \u201cI know what you\u2019re saying.

That will only get you hurt, and whatever you do\u2026\u201d He buries his face in my neck, inhaling deeply . \u201cDon\u2019 t fall for me.\u201d I stroke my hand over his mark ed arm and pray that\u2019s not exactly what I\u2019m doing. This overwhelming juxtaposition of longing and satisfaction in my chest has to be the afteref fects of coming not once but three times, right? It can\u2019 t be more.",
  "\u201cViolence?\u201d I look out my window at the infinite black sky and change the topic, my eyelids growing heavier by the second. \u201cWhy did you guess I could wield lightning?\u201d He stretches just enough to tuck my head under his chin. \u201cI thought you did it the first night Tairn channeled power to you, but I wasn \u2019t sure, so I didn\u2019 t say anything.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I blink, thinking back, but my brain is full of a pleasant, dull hum as sleep fights to pull me under . \u201cWhen?\u201d My eyes drift shut. His arms tighten around me as he tucks me closer , the backs of my thighs pressed tight against his pants as I start to drift of f. \u201cThe first time you kissed me.\u201d \u2026 When I wake, Xaden is gone, but that\u2019s not exactly a surprise. Him staying the night to begin with? Now that was the shocker . Finding a jar on my nightstand with a handful of spring violets? My heart swells. I\u2019m in so much fucking trouble.",
  "He even moved all the debris to a pile in the corner , which means he must have used his shadows while I was sleeping because I didn\u2019 t hear a thing. I\u2019m still exhausted, but I dress and pin my hair up quickly , noting the sunhas already risen. With Liam in the infirmary , I\u2019ll be solo for my Archives trip today , but I might be able to sneak in to see him on the way back.

Another talks about the dangers of wielding power from the groun d instead of the skies, as one could easily start drawing magic from the earth and eventually be driven mad. One of the purpo ses of the fable s is to teach children about the dangers of too much power .

And he can avoid it all he wants, but we\u2019re going to end up right here time and again until he\u2019s willing to recognize what this is. Because if there\u2019 s one thing I know for certain, it\u2019 s that I\u2019m going to fall for this man\u2014 if I have n\u2019t already\u2014and he\u2019s halfway there, too, whether he realizes it or not. Turning my back on him, I walk to the shattered halves of my throwing target and pick them up before heading back across my room. \u201cI never figured you for a liar, Xaden.\u201d I shove the halves at his chest. \u201cYou can get me a new one when you\u2019re ready to come to your senses. Then we\u2019ll blow off some steam.\u201d I throw the aggravating man out.",
  "\u2026 \u201cDid you hear that King Tauri is celebrating Reunification Day here?\u201d Sawyer asks as he swings his leg over the bench beside me at lunch. \u201cReally?\u201d I attack my roasted chicken with zeal. Since I\u2019ve been training every day with Carr, my appetite somewhat resembles a bottomless pit. At least he only drags me to that mountaintop for an hour a day, but still, by the time breakfast comes, I\u2019m ravenous. After a month, I still can\u2019t aim lightning for shit. But I\u2019m up to about twenty strikes an hour, so that\u2019s an improvement. Glancing down the tables, I catch Xaden\u2019 s eye as he eats with the leadership on the dais. He looks scrumptious this morning. Even the broody little cloud that follows him everywhere has a certain appeal as he rolls his eyes at something Garrick says. \u201cDon\u2019 t look at me like that.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d I arch an eyebrow . His gaze flashes to mine. \u201cLike you\u2019r e thinking about the sparring gym last night.\u201d \u201cWell, duh,\u201d Rhiannon says across from me.",
  "\u201cThat\u2019 s why Devera has about five hundred black dress uniforms in commons right now. Where the king travels, so does the party .\u201d \u201cWell, now that you mention it.\u201d My tongue flicks over my lower lip, remembering how his hips pinned mine to the mat after everyone had left for the night. How close we both came to giving in to the pulsing need between us. His jaw flexes, and his grip tightens on his fork. \u201cSeriously . I can\u2019t think when you look at me like that.\u201d \u201cReally? I figured those were for graduation?\u201d Ridoc questions. Imogen scoffs. \u201cLike anyone dresses up for graduation. It\u2019s basically a giant formation where Panchek says, Look, you lived. Good job. Come get your assignments and then pack your shit and leave. \u201d Everyone laughs at her spot-on imitation.",
  "\u201cYou\u2019re the one with the ridiculous rule about not falling for each other ,\u201d I remind him. \u201cYou\u2019re still looking.\u201d He forces his attention back to his plate. \u201cYou make it har d to look away .\u201d I miss his mouth on my skin, the feel of his body pressed against mine. I miss the look on his face when he watched me come undone. But I miss the feeling of him curled around me in sleep more. \u201cI\u2019m over here keeping my hands and memories to myself because you asked me to, and you\u2019r e fucking me with your eyes. That\u2019 s not playing fair .\u201d I drop my fork and everyone at the table turns to stare. \u201cYou all right over there?\u201d Rhiannon asks, her eyebrows rising. \u201cYep.\u201d I nod, ignoring the flush of heat creeping up my neck. \u201cI\u2019m great.\u201d Liam sets his glass down and glances between Xaden and me, shaking hishead as he fights a smile. Of course he knows what\u2019 s going on. He\u2019d have to be completely oblivious not to, considering he helped Xaden and Garrick move in the new armoire. \u201cTold you to stop staring.\u201d There\u2019s laughter in his voice, but his face is as expressionless as ever . I tap my fork on my plate in pure frustration. You know what? Fuck this. Two can play at this game.",
  "\u201cIf you\u2019d just man up and admit there\u2019s something betwe en us, I would strip down to my skin so you could see every single inch of me. And once I had you begging, I\u2019d drop down to my knees, undo those flight leathers you\u2019r e wearing, and wrap my lips ar ound\u2014\u201d Xaden chokes. Every head in the dining hall turns his way, and Garrick pounds on his back until Xaden waves him of f, taking a drink of his water . I grin, which earns me about six looks of confusion from our table and one set of rolled eyes from Liam. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me.\u201d \u2026 We\u2019re only ten days away from graduation, and I\u2019m counting every single one of them. That\u2019 s when we\u2019ll find out how far Xaden is being sent from Basgiath. Most brand-new lieute nants are given midland posts, manning the forts along the roads that lead to the border outposts, but someone with Xaden\u2019 s power? I don\u2019 t even want to think about how far he\u2019ll be. Or why he still hasn\u2019 t admitted there\u2019 s something between us. Or even hinted that at least he didn\u2019 t regret that one night. I\u2019d take that.",
  "Don\u2019 t fall for me\u2026 I feel a familiar prickle along my scalp, and I know Xaden has filed into the Battle Brief room with the rest of the remaining cadets and leadership. Professor Dever a jumps right into today\u2019 s brief, but I find it difficult to pay attention.Today marks six years since Brennan was killed. He\u2019d be a captain by now, or maybe even a major , given the way his career had taken off. Maybe he\u2019d be married. Maybe I\u2019d be an aunt. Maybe our father \u2019s heart wouldn\u2019 t have given out that first time from the strain of losing him or that final time that spring two years ago. \u201cTake me to bed,\u201d I menta lly blurt out, then sink down in my seat a little. I don\u2019 t regret it, though.",
  "T oday of all days, I need a distraction. \u201cIt might be awkwar d in fr ont of all these people.\u201d I can\u2019t see him from where I know he\u2019s sitting at the top of the Battle Brief room, but his words feel like a caress on the back of my neck. \u201cMight be worth it.\u201d \u201cAnd what would you have done differently?\u201d Devera asks, scanning the crowd. \u201cI would have asked for reinforcements if I\u2019d known the wards were weakening in the area,\u201d Rhiannon answers. \u201cI haven\u2019 t changed my mind, V iolence. Ther e\u2019s no futur e for us.",
  "\u201d \u201cAnd when no reinforcements are available?\u201d Devera asks, arching a brow . \u201cYou have noticed that the graduating classes from the Riders Quadrant are diminishing every year, while the uptick in attacks has cost us another seven riders and their dragons this year, haven\u2019 t you? It takes at least a full company of infantry to make up for the loss of one rider .\u201d \u201cGraduation is ten days away .\u201d The approachin g deadline has me on edge. \u201cI would have temporarily pulled riders from the midland posts to help rebuild the wards,\u201d Rhiannon answers. \u201cDon\u2019 t remind me.\u201d \u201cExcellent.\u201d Devera nods. \u201cAre you seriously going to leave Basgiath without\u2014\u201d Without what? Declaring his undying\u2026lust? \u201cYes.\u201dOf course he would. Xaden is a master of containing his emotions, which is probably why he\u2019s so fixed on containing mine, too. Or is there some other reason he\u2019s holding himself back that I\u2019m not considering?",
  "The sex was great. Our chemistry? Explosive. We\u2019re even\u2026friends, though the constant ache in my chest tells me it\u2019s gone far beyond that. If he could just be an asshole, then I\u2019d write that night off as just sex\u2014ridiculously mind- blowing sex\u2014and move on. But he\u2019s not being an ass\u2026not usually at least, and now I understand why he takes his job so seriously . He shoulders the responsibility for every marked one in here. \u201cWhatever you\u2019r e thinking can wait until there\u2019s not a room of people between us,\u201d he says.",
  "\u201cWhat else do you have for me?\u201d Devera continues, calling on a second- year. It\u2019s been a month and a half since we destroyed my room\u2014and we\u2019ve managed to keep our hands off each other , even though one night wasn\u2019 t enough to satisfy either of us, if the tension-filled evenings on the sparring mats are any indication. Of course, we both know anything more would only further complicate an already overly complicated situation. But surely he\u2019s not relieving this sexual tension that stretches taut between us\u2014wi th someone else. Surely . The insidious thought spreads with a sickening quickness. I stop listening as my stomach twists at an all-too-real possi bility . \u201cIs there someone else?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not having this discussion with you right now . Pay attention.\u201d It takes everything I have not to turn around and yell at him. If I\u2019ve spent every night tossing and turning in my sheets alone while he\u2014 \u201cThat\u2019 s a good idea, too, Aeto s.\u201d Devera smiles. \u201cA very wingleader answer , if I might say so.\u201d Oh gods , Dain\u2019 s ego is going to be unbearable today during sparring if Devera keeps complimenting him.Sparring\u2026 I clasp my pen a little too hard as I remember the way Imogen looked at Xaden that night. Shit.",
  "That would make sense. She carries a rebellion relic, and definitely isn\u2019 t the daughter of the woman who killed his father , so she has that going for her , too.",
  "\u201cIs it Imogen?\u201d I\u2019m going to be sick. \u201cFor fuck\u2019 s sake, V iolence.\u201d \u201cIs it? I know we said we weren\u2019t going there again, but\u2014\u201d I\u2019m kicking myself for telling him I wanted more now, and for the fact that I should be paying attention instead of fighting with Xaden. \u201cAt least tell me.\u201d \u201cSorrengail,\u201d Xaden snaps. I freeze, feeling the weight of every gaze on me. \u201cYes, Riorson?\u201d Devera prompts. He clears his throat. \u201cIf reinforcements were unavailable, I would have asked for Mira Sorrengail to temporarily transfer . The wards are strong at Montserrat, and with her signet, she could reinforce the weaknesses until other riders could arrive to strengthen those wards.\u201d \u201cGood idea.\u201d Devera nods. \u201cAnd what riders are the most logical choice to help rebuild the wards in this particular mountain pass?\u201d \u201cThird-years,\u201d I answer . \u201cGo on.\u201d Devera tilts her head at me. \u201cThird-years are taught to build wards, and at this point in the year, they\u2019re leaving anyway .\u201d I shrug . \u201cMay as well send them early so they can be of use.\u201d \u201cPoint fucking made.\u201d I slam my shield down and block him out. \u201cThat\u2019 s a logical choice,\u201d Dever a says.",
  "\u201cAnd that\u2019s all we have for today . Don\u2019 t forget that you should be preparing for the last exercise of War Games before graduation. Also we expect each and every one of you in the courtyard in front of Basgiath tonight at nine for fireworks to celebrate Reunification Day . Dress uniforms only .\u201d She lifts her brows at Ridoc.He shrugs. \u201cWhat else would I be wearing?\u201d \u201cOne never knows what you\u2019ll come up with,\u201d Devera says, dismissing us. \u201cAnything I need to know about what\u2019 s going on between you and\u2026\u201d Liam raises his eyebrows at me as we gather our things. \u201cAbsolutely nothing is going on between us. Not one damn thing,\u201d I insist. If Xaden doesn\u2019 t want to see if there might be more between us, message received. I turn to Rhiannon. \u201cSo are you excited to finally be able to write to your sister in ten days?\u201d She grins. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing her once a month since we got here. Now I\u2019ll finally get to post them.\u201d At least one good thing is coming with graduation. We\u2019ll all be able to talk to our loved ones again.",
  "\u2026 Later that night, I adjust the sash across the bodice of my black dress uniform and tuck a loose strand of my hair back into the pretty arrangement Quinn helped me with earlier before meeting Rhiannon in the hallway . She\u2019s unbound her hair from its usual braided, protective style, and the tight coils form a beautiful halo around her face, which she\u2019s dusted with gold-tinted blush. Her chosen option of sleek, tailored dress pants and a cross-body doublet that cuts across her torso on the diagonal looks phenomenal on her taller frame. \u201cHot,\u201d I say with a nod as she tugs on her sash. I went with the high neck, sleeveless option to hide my armor and the flowing, floor -length skirt with the slit up the thigh, which Devera told me was for mobility in case of attack. Personally , I\u2019m not against the flash of thigh it gives when I move, especially with all the work I\u2019ve put in to strengthen my legs with Imogen. My sash is simple, the same black satin as everyone else\u2019s, with my name embroidered just beneath my shoulder andthe star of a first-year .",
  "\u201cI heard there\u2019 s going to be a mob of infantry guys there,\u201d Nadin e says as she joins us. \u201cDon\u2019 t you prefer a little brain with your brawn?\u201d Ridoc slides right in, Sawyer at his side. \u201cYou did not try to leave without me!\u201d Liam shouts as he runs forward, darting through the crowd as we move toward the staircase that leads to Basgiath\u2019 s main campus. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d been given the night off,\u201d I answer truthfully as he reaches my side. \u201cDon\u2019 t you look handsome.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d He preens sarcastically , straightening his sash over a midnight- black doublet. \u201cI\u2019ve heard healer cadets have a thing for riders.\u201d \u201cHardly .\u201d Rhian non laughs.",
  "\u201cAs often as they have to put us back together? I bet they\u2019re more into scribes.\u201d \u201cWhat are scrib es into?\u201d Liam asks me as we descend the stairs in a sea of black, taking the path we tread every morning toward the Archives. \u201cSeeing as you were almost one of them?\u201d \u201cUsually other scribes,\u201d I answer . \u201cBut I guess riders, in my father \u2019s case.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just excited to see some people who aren\u2019 t riders,\u201d Ridoc says, holding open the door so we can pass through the tunnel. \u201cIt\u2019s getting kind of incestuous around here.\u201d \u201cAgreed.\u201d Rhiannon nods. \u201cOh, whatever . You and Tara have been on again, off again all year,\u201d Nadine says, then blanches. \u201cShit. Are you of f again?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re taking a breather until Parapet,\u201d she says, and we enter the Healer Quadrant. \u201cHard to believe we\u2019ll be second-years in a little more than two weeks,\u201d Sawyer says. \u201cHard to believe we\u2019ve survived,\u201d I add. There was only one name on thedeath roll this week, a third-year who didn\u2019 t come back from an overnight mission.",
  "By the time we make it to the courtyard, the party is in full swing. There\u2019 s a blend of pale blue for the heale rs, cream for the scribes, and the navy-blue uniforms of the infantry more than overwhelming the scattered black uniforms. There must be a thousand people or more in here. Mage lights hang above us in the form of a dozen chandeliers, and drapes of rich velvets cover the stone walls of Basgiath, transforming the functional outdoor space into a ballroom of sorts. There\u2019 s even a string quartet playing in the corner . \u201cWher e are you?\u201d I ask Xaden, but there\u2019 s no answer . We all seem to scatter as we enter , but Liam stays at my side, as tense as the string on my crossbow . \u201cTell me you\u2019re wearing your armor under all that.\u201d \u201cYou think someone is going to knife me in front of my mother?\u201d I gesture to the exposed balcony where Mom appears to be holding court, surveying her domain. Our gazes collide and she whispers some thing to the man next to her , disappearing from view .",
  "Nice to see you, too. \u201cI think if anyone was going to knife you, now would be the time, especially knowing that killing you has a good chance of ending Fen Riorson\u2019 s son.\u201d His voice tightens. That\u2019 s when I notice the stares of the officers and cadets around us. They\u2019re not gawking at my hair or the name on my sash. No, their gazes widen at Liam\u2019 s wrist and the visible swirls of his rebellion relic. I hook my arm through his and lift my chin. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry .\u201d \u201cThere is absolutely nothing for you to be sorry about.\u201d He gives my hand a reassuring pat. \u201cOf course there is,\u201d I whisper . Oh gods, everyone is here to gather in celebration of the end of what he and the others call the apostasy . They\u2019recelebrating his mother \u2019s death.",
  "\u201cYou can go. You should go. This is\u2026\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI go where you go.\u201d His hand tightens over mine. A bould er lodges in my throat, and I scan the crowd, instinctively knowing that he\u2019s not here. There\u2019 s no Garrick, no Bodhi, no Imogen, and definitely no Xaden. No wonder he was in such a shit mood today . \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair to you.\u201d I glare at the infantry officer who has the nerve to look appalled at the sight of Liam\u2019 s wrist. \u201cI highly doubt you enjoy celeb rating the anniversary of your brother \u2019s death, either .\u201d Liam holds himself with a dignity I could never imagine. \u201cBrennan would hate all of this.\u201d I gesture to the crowd. \u201cHe was more about getting the work done than celebrating its completion.\u201d \u201cYeah, sounds like\u2014\u201d His word s die, and I squeeze his arm tighter as I note the separating crowd before us. King Tauri walks at my mother \u2019s side, and from the direction of his wide, toothy smile, he\u2019s headed this way.",
  "A purple sash crosses his doublet, pinned to his chest by a dozen medals he\u2019s never won from a hundred battlefields he\u2019 s never stepped foot on. Mom\u2019 s medals are all earned, and they adorn her black sash like jewelry as it drapes across her high-necked, long-sleeve dress uniform. \u201cGo,\u201d I hiss at Liam in a whisper , forcing a smile for my mother \u2019s sake as General Melgre n joins them. Melgren may be brilliant, but he\u2019s also unnerving as fuck to be around. \u201cWhen your greatest danger approaches? I think not.\u201d His spine straightens. I\u2019m going to rip Xaden\u2019 s gor geous head of f for forcing Liam through this. \u201cYour Majesty ,\u201d I murmur , dropping a foot behind me like Mira taught and bending as I bow my head, noting that Liam has bowed at the waist. \u201cYour mother tells me you\u2019ve bonded with not one but two exceptional dragons,\u201d King T auri says, smiling under his mustache.\u201cYes, she is quite confident in your power ,\u201d Melgren adds, his smile icy as he stares at me in blatant appraisal. \u201cI would not say the same at this time,\u201d I answer with a polite smile. I\u2019ve spent enough time around egotistical generals, politicians, and royalty to know when to be humble.",
  "\u201cI\u2019m still learning how to wield.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t be so modest, daughter ,\u201d Mom chides. \u201cFrom what her professors say, they\u2019ve only seen a gift this powerful a few times in the last decade, in Brennan and the Riorson boy .\u201d That boy is a twenty-thre e-year -old man, but I know better than to correc t her and put an even bigger tar get on Xaden\u2019 s back. \u201cAnd your gift?\u201d King T auri asks Liam. \u201cFarsight, Y our Majesty ,\u201d Liam responds. Melgren\u2019 s eyes narrow on Liam \u2019s exposed rebellion relic, then rise to his sash. \u201cMairi, as in Colonel Mairi\u2019 s son?\u201d I squeeze his arm tighter against mine in silent support, and Mom notices. \u201cYes, General. Though I was mostly brought up by Duke Lindell at Tirvainne.\u201d His jaw flexes, but that\u2019s the only physical sign of his discomfort. \u201cAhh.\u201d King Tauri nods. \u201cYes, Duke Lindell is a good man, a loyal man.\u201d The superiority in his air makes me want to snatch the medals of f his chest. \u201cI have him to thank for my fortitude, Majesty .\u201d Liam plays the game well. \u201cYes, you do.\u201d Melgren nods again, his gaze scanning the crowd.",
  "\u201cNow tell me, where is the Riorson boy? I always like to lay eyes on him once a year and make sure he\u2019 s not causing trouble.\u201d \u201cNo trouble,\u201d I answer , earning a swift glare from Mom. \u201cHe\u2019s our wingleader , actually. He saved my life when we were on the front lines at Montserrat.\u201d By making me leave instead of staying to help, but still, he deserves the credit for me not distracting Mira and getting her, myself, and Tairn killed. Xaden\u2019 s done more than save me. He believed me when I toldhim Amber led the unbondeds to my room. He had an entire arsenal of daggers crafted just for me. He designed a saddle for Tairn so I can ride into battle with my peers. He\u2019d protected me when I needed and taught me to defend myself so I wouldn\u2019 t require protection forever . And when other s are quick to stand in front of me, Xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold my own.",
  "But I don\u2019t say any of that. Wha t\u2019s the point? Xaden wouldn\u2019 t give a fuck what these peop le think of him\u2014 so I won\u2019 t, either . Instead, I just continue to offer a simpering smile, seemingly in awe of the powerful men before me. \u201cTheir dragons are mated,\u201d Mom offers, her smile chilling. \u201cSo she\u2019s grown quite close to him out of necessity .\u201d Out of lust and need and the ache in my chest I\u2019m terrified to define, but sure, necessity works. \u201cThat\u2019 s excellen t.\u201d King Tauri beams. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a Sorrengail on lookout for us. You\u2019ll let us know if he decides to, oh, I don\u2019t know .\u201d He laughs. \u201cStart another war?\u201d Melgren is fully capable of seeing the outcome of any such absurdity, and yet he stares at Liam and me with unnerving focus. My entire body tenses. \u201cI can assure you, he\u2019 s loyal.\u201d \u201cSo where is he?\u201d King Tauri scans the courtyard. \u201cI asked that they all be here, all marked ones.\u201d \u201cI just saw him a little earlier .\u201d I smile through the not-quite lie. Battle Brief was earlier .",
  "\u201cI\u2019d check the edges? He\u2019 s not much for parties.\u201d \u201cOh, look! Ther e\u2019s Dain Aetos!\u201d Mom says, nodding somewhere behind my shoulder . \u201cHe\u2019d be so humbled if you said hello,\u201d she prompts the king. \u201cOf course.\u201d The three of them walk off, leaving Liam and me standing in complete silence as we pivot to watch them so we don\u2019t accidentally turn our back s on the king. I feel like I\u2019ve just survived certain death, or at least some kind of natural disaster .\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him for making you come to this,\u201d I mutter under my breath as Dain greets the king with perfect manners. \u201cXaden didn\u2019 t make me come.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d My gaze jumps to his. \u201cHe\u2019d never ask this of me. Never ask it of anyone.",
  "But I told him I would keep you safe, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing, keeping you safe.\u201d He flashes a crooked smile. \u201cYou are a good friend, Liam Mairi.\u201d I rest my head on his arm. \u201cYou saved my life, Violet. The least I can do is grin and bear it through a fucking party .\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can grin and bear it.\u201d Not with the way people constantly glance at his wrist, like he\u2019s the one who personally led the army to the border . Dain smiles as the king takes his leave, then glances over his shoulder , meeting my gaze and heading our way . He grins , and it\u2019s all too easy to remember how many events just like this we\u2019ve attended together over the years. His touch is gentle when he cups my cheek. \u201cY ou look beautiful tonight, V i.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d I smile. \u201cY ou look fabulous yourself.\u201d His hand falls away as he turns to Liam. \u201cHas this one tried to escape yet? She\u2019 s always hated these things.\u201d \u201cNot yet, but the evening is young,\u201d Liam replies. Dain must read the tense lines of Liam\u2019 s face, because his smile slips when he looks back at me. \u201cThe staircase is about five feet to our right.",
  "I\u2019ll distract while you slip away .\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d I nod in thanks, offering him a soft smile.",
  "\u201cLet\u2019 s get out of here,\u201d I say to Liam. Once we\u2019re out of the party and back in the Riders Quadran t, I walk straight into the courtyard and ground, letting power swirl around and through me. I sense the golden energy from Andarna, the blazing powerfrom Tairn that connects me to Sgaeyl, and finally , the shimmering shadows of Xaden. I open my eyes, tracing the ebb and flow of that shimmering shadow , and I know he\u2019 s somewhere in front of me. \u201cLiam, you know I adore you, right?\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019 s nice\u2014\u201d \u201cGo away .\u201d I walk straight ahead through the courtyard. \u201cWhat?\u201d Liam catches up to me. \u201cI can\u2019t just leave you out here by yourself.\u201d \u201cNo offense, but I can fry this entire place with a lightning bolt if I want to, and I need to see Xaden, so go.\u201d I pat his arm and keep striding toward the feeling, using it to guide me. \u201cI mean , your aim is shit according to you, but I get the rest!\u201d he calls out, falling behind. I don\u2019t bother with a mage light as I pass the area where we usually stand in formation and keep walking toward the figures lounging against the only opening in this godsforsaken wall.",
  "There\u2019 s only one place Xaden can be. \u201cTell me he\u2019s not out there,\u201d I say to Garrick and Bodhi, whose features I can barely see in the moonlight. \u201cI could tell you that, but I\u2019d be lying,\u201d Bodhi remarks, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to want to see him. Not tonight, Sorrengail,\u201d Garrick warns with a grimace. \u201cSelf-pre servation is a thing. Notice we\u2019re not with him, and we\u2019re his best friends.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m his\u2026\u201d I open my mouth and shut it a few times because\u2026fuck if I know what I am to him. But the longing that holds my heart hostage, this driving need to be at his side because I know he\u2019s suffering, no matter if it means throwing myself headfirst into uncertainty\u2026 I can\u2019t deny what he is to me.",
  "I kick off the leather slippers of my dress uniform\u2014they\u2019re more of a hazard than anything, and in this wind? Well,we\u2019ll see how it goes. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026his.\u201d For the first time since last year , I step up onto the parapet.As for the 107 innocents, the childr en of the executed officers, they now carry what shall be known as the r ebellion r elic, transferr ed by the dragon who carried out the king\u2019 s justice. And to show the mercy of our gr eat king, they will all be conscripted into the prestigious Riders Quadrant at Basgiath, so they may pr ove their loyalty to our kingdom with their service or with their death. \u2014A DDENDUM 4.2, THE TREA TY OF ARETIA CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO Walking the parapet on Conscription Day is a certifiable risk. Walking the parapet in a dress uniform, barefoot, in the dark? Now this is madness.",
  "The first ten feet, while I\u2019m still inside the walls, are the easiest , and as I reach the edge, where the wind ruffles my skirt like a sail, I start to doubt my plan. It\u2019 s going to be hard to get to Xaden if I fall to my death. But I see him sitting about a third of the way across the narrow stone bridge, staring up at the moon like it somehow adds to the burden he carries, and my heart fucking hurts. He had the lives of all one hundred and seven marked ones carved into his back, taking responsibility for them. But who takes responsibility\u2014takes care\u2014of him? Everyone across the ravine is celebrating his father \u2019s death, and he\u2019s out here mourning it alone. When Brennan died, I had Mira and Dad, but Xaden\u2019 s had no one. You don\u2019t really know me. Not at my core. Isn\u2019t that how he replied when I told him that I\u2019d end up falling for him? As if knowing him would somehow make me want him less, but everything I learn about him onlymakes me tumble harder and faster . Oh gods. I know this feeling. Denying it doesn\u2019 t make it any less true. My feelings are what they are.",
  "I haven\u2019 t run from a challenge since I crossed this parapet a year ago, and I\u2019m not about to start now . The last time I stood here, I was terrified, but the distance to the ground isn\u2019t what has my pulse pounding now. There\u2019 s more than one way to fall. Shit. That ache in my chest burns brighter than the power coursing through my veins. I\u2019m in love with Xaden. It doesn \u2019t matte r that he\u2019s leavi ng soon or that he probably doesn\u2019 t feel the same for me. It doesn\u2019 t even matter that he warned me not to fall for him. It\u2019s not an infatuation, our physical chemistry , or even the bond between our dragons that keeps me reaching in every way possible for this man. It\u2019 s my reckless heart. I\u2019ve kept out of his bed\u2014out of his arms\u2014because he\u2019s adamant I can\u2019t fall for him, but that ship has long sailed, so what\u2019 s the point in holding back? Shouldn\u2019 t I grab hold of every moment we can have while he\u2019s still here?",
  "I take the first step onto the narrow stone bridge and put my arms out for balance. It\u2019 s just like walking along T airn\u2019s spine, which I\u2019ve done hundreds of times. Except I\u2019m in a dress. And T airn isn\u2019 t going to catch me if I fall. He\u2019s going to be so pissed when he hears that I did this\u2014 \u201cAlready am.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s head snaps in my direction. \u201cV iolence?\u201d I take a step and then another , holding my frame upright with muscle memory I didn\u2019 t have last year , and begin to cross. Xaden swings his legs up and then fucking jumps to his feet. \u201cTurn around right now!\u201d he shouts.\u201cCome with me,\u201d I call over the wind, bracing myself as a gust whips my skirt against my legs. \u201cShould have gone with the pants,\u201d I mutter and keep walking. He\u2019s already coming my way, his strides just as long and confident as if he was on solid ground, eating up the distance between us as I move forward slowly until we meet. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing out here?\u201d he asks, locking his hands on my waist. He\u2019 s in riding leathers, not a dress uniform, and he\u2019 s never looked better . What am I doing out here?",
  "I\u2019m risking everything to reach him. And if he rejects me\u2026 No. There\u2019 s no room for fear on the parapet.",
  "\u201cI could ask you the same thing.\u201d His eyes widen. \u201cY ou could have fallen and died!\u201d \u201cI could say the same thing.\u201d I smile, but it\u2019s shaky . The look in his eyes is wild, like he\u2019s been driven past the point where he can contai n himself in the neat, apathetic facade he usually wears in public. It doesn\u2019 t scare me. I like him better when he\u2019 s real with me anyway . \u201cAnd did you stop to think that if you fall and die, then I can die?\u201d He leans in and my pulse jumps. \u201cAgain,\u201d I say softly , resting my hands on his firm chest, right above his heartbeat. \u201cI could say the same thing.\u201d Even if Xaden\u2019 s death wouldn\u2019 t kill Sgaeyl, I\u2019m not sure I could survive it. Shadows rise, darker than the night that surrounds us. \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting that I wield shadows, Violence . I\u2019m just as safe out here as I am in the courtyard. Are you going to wield lightning to break your fall?\u201d Fine. That\u2019 s a good point. \u201cI\u2026perhaps did not think that part through as thoroughly as you,\u201d I admit. I wanted to be close to him, so I got close, parapet be damned. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously going to be the death of me.\u201d His fingers flex at my waist.",
  "\u201cGo back.\u201dIt\u2019s not a rejection, not with the way he\u2019s looking at me. We\u2019ve been sparring emotion ally for the past month, hell, even longer than that, and one of us has to expose our jugular . I finally trust him enough to know he won\u2019 t go for the kill. \u201cOnly if you do. I want to be wherever you are.\u201d And I mean it. Everyone else\u2014everything else in the world can fall away and I won\u2019 t care as long as I\u2019m with him. \u201cViolence\u2026\u201d \u201cI know why you said you don\u2019t see a future for us.\u201d My heart races like it\u2019s trying to take flight as I blurt out the words. \u201cDo you?\u201d Of course he isn\u2019t going to make this easy. I\u2019m not sure the man even knows what easy is. \u201cYou want me,\u201d I say, looking him in the eyes. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not just talking about in bed.",
  "You. Want. Me, Xaden Riorson. You migh t not say it, but you do one better and show it. You show it every time you choose to trust me, every time your eyes linger on mine. You show it with every sparring lesson you don \u2019 t have time for and every flight lesson that pulls you away from your own studie s. You show it when you refuse to touch me because you \u2019 re worried I don \u2019 t really want you , then show it again when you take the time to hunt down violets",
  "before a leadership meeting so I don \u2019 t wake up feeling alone . You show it in a million different ways. Please don\u2019t deny it.\u201d His jaw flexes, but he doesn\u2019 t deny it. \u201cYou think we don\u2019t have a future because you\u2019re scared that I won\u2019 t like who you really are behind all those walls you keep. And I\u2019m scared, too. I can admit it. You\u2019re graduating. I\u2019m not. You\u2019ll be gone in a matter of weeks, and we\u2019re probably setting ourselves up for heartbreak. But if we let fear kill whatev er this is between us, then we don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d I lift one hand to the back of his neck. \u201cI told you that I was the one who would decide when I\u2019m ready to risk my heart, and I\u2019m saying it.\u201dThe way he looks at me, with the same mix of hope and apprehension currently flooding my system, gives me absolute life. \u201cYou don\u2019 t mean that,\u201d he says, shaking his head.",
  "And there he goes, sucking the life right out again. \u201cI mean it.\u201d \u201cIf this is about the Imogen thing\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d I shake my head, the wind catching the curls Quinn spent so much time on. \u201cI know there\u2019 s no one else. I wouldn\u2019 t be walking the parapet in the middle of the night if I thought you were playing me.\u201d His brow furrows, and he pulls me in closer against the warmth of his body . \u201cThen what made you even think that? Have to admit, it pissed me off.",
  "I\u2019ve given you exactly zero reasons to think I\u2019m in anyone else\u2019 s bed.\u201d Which means he\u2019 s only in mine. \u201cMy own insecurities and the way she looked at you and Garrick sparring. You might not have a thing for her, but she definitely has one for you. I know that look. It\u2019s the same look I have when I\u2019m watching you.\u201d Embarrassment heats my cheek s. I could change the subject or deflect, but it\u2019s not going to do our relationship\u2014if that\u2019s even what this is\u2014any favors if I hide my feelings, no matter how weak the irrational ones might make me seem. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201d He bites back a smile. \u201cMaybe,\u201d I admit, then decide that answer is half-assed. \u201cFine. Yes. She\u2019s strong and fierce and has that same ruthless streak you do. I\u2019ve always thought she was a better match for you.\u201d \u201cI know the feeling well.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAnd you are strong and fierce and have a ruthless streak, too. Not to mention you\u2019re the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met. That mind of yours is sexy as hell. Imogen and I are just frien ds.",
  "Trust me, she wasn \u2019t looking at me, and even if she were\u2026\u201d He pauses, his hand slipping to cradle the back of my head as he holds us steady despite the gusting wind. \u201cGods help me, I\u2019m only looking at you.\u201dHope is a stronger buzz than anything they were serving at the party . \u201cShe wasn\u2019 t looking at you?\u201d \u201cNo. Rethink what you just said but take me out of the equation.\u201d He lifts his brows, waiting for me to come to the right conclusion. \u201cBut on the sparring mat\u2026\u201d My eyes widen. \u201cShe has a thing for Garrick.\u201d \u201cCatching on fast, aren\u2019 t you?\u201d \u201cI am. Are you done pushing me away?\u201d He draws back, searching my eyes in the moonlight before glancing over my shou lder. \u201cYou done putting yourself in harm\u2019 s way to get your point across?\u201d \u201cProbably not.\u201d He sighs. \u201cThere\u2019 s only you, V iolence. Is that what you needed to hear?\u201d I nod. \u201cEven when I\u2019m not with you, there\u2019 s only you. Next time, just ask.",
  "You\u2019ve never had a problem being bluntly honest with me.\u201d Wind blows around us, but he\u2019s as immovable as the parapet itself. \u201cAs I remember , you\u2019ve even thrown daggers at my head, which I greatly prefer over watching you get tangled up in your thoughts. If we\u2019re going to do this, then we have to trust each other .\u201d \u201cAnd you want to do this?\u201d I hold my breath. He sighs , long and hard, then admits, \u201cYes.\u201d His hand slides up, and he caresses my cheek with his thumb. \u201cI can\u2019t make you any promises, Violence.",
  "But I\u2019m tired of fighting it.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d One word has never meant so much to me. Then I blink, remembering his previous comment about jealousy . \u201cWhat do you mean you know the feeling of jealousy well?\u201d His hands tighten on my waist, and he looks away . \u201cOh no, if I have to trust you and tell you what I\u2019m thinking, then I expect the same from you.\u201d I\u2019m not going to be the only vulnera ble one outon this ledge.

And you know Dain and I are just friends, right?\u201d \u201cI know that\u2019s how you feel, though I wasn\u2019 t sure back then.\u201d He runs his thumb over the swell of my lips. \u201cNow get your ass back on solid ground.\u201d He wants to stay out here and wallow . \u201cCome with me.\u201d My fingers grasp the material of his flight leathers, ready to tug him along if I have to.

  "\u201cI\u2019m not in a place to take care of anyone tonight.

The second we\u2019re within the confines of the wall, he hauls me againsthim, my back to his front. \u201cDon \u2019t ever put your life at risk over something as trivial as talking to me again.\u201d It\u2019s as low as a growl against my ear, sending a shiver down my spine.",
  "\u201cNext year is going to be so much fun,\u201d I tease, walking forward and lacing my fingers with his so he follows. \u201cLiam will be here next year to make sure you\u2019re not doing asinine things,\u201d he mutters. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love getting his letters,\u201d I promise, jumping the final foot off the parapet to the courtyard below . \u201cHuh.\u201d I glance around the empty courtyard while putting my slippers back on. \u201cGarrick and Bodhi were just here.\u201d \u201cThey probably know I\u2019m going to kill them for letting you out there.",
  "A dress, Sorrengail? Really?\u201d I take his hand in mine and head across the courtyard. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d He sounds just as much the asshole as the day I met him. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me to your room ,\u201d I say over my shoulder as we approach the dormitory . \u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d I throw open the door, grateful for the mage lights that make it easy to see him now, sneer and all. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me to your room.\u201d Turning left, I lead us past the hallway to my room and then start up the wide spiral staircase. \u201cSomeone will see,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt\u2019s not my reputation I\u2019m worried about, Sorrengail. Y ou\u2019re a first-year and I\u2019m your wingleader\u2014\u201d \u201cPretty sure everyone already knows\u2014we set half the forest on fire that night,\u201d I remind him as we climb past the door to the second-year hallway .",

  "But his shadows don\u2019t scare me. There\u2019 s nothing about this man that scares me anymore, except the magnitude of my feelings for him. \u201cPoint is, and now look at me.\u201d I grin as we reach the third-y ear floor , and I push open the arched door. \u201cAll but dancing on the parapet in a dress.\u201d \u201cProbably not a good time to remind me.\u201d He follows me into the hallway . It looks like the second-year floor , except there are fewer doors and a high, vaulted roof. \u201cWhich one is yours?\u201d \u201cI should make you guess,\u201d he mutters but keeps my fingers laced with his as we walk to the end of the massively long hall. Of course it\u2019s the last one. \u201cFourth W ing,\u201d I scof f. \u201cAlways has to go the farthest.\u201d He unweaves his own wards and opens his door, standing back so I can walk in first. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to either ward your new door before I go or teach you how in the next ten days.\u201d I\u2019m not thinking about the loom ing deadline of his departure as I step into his room for the first time.

  "Surviving to third year has some serious perks. Or maybe the size reflects his rank, who knows. It\u2019s immaculatel y clean, with a large armchair by the bed, dark-gray rug, wide wooden armoire, tidy desk, and a bookshelf that gives me instant envy . A sword rack consumes the area beside the door, complete with so many daggers that I can\u2019t possibly count them all, and across the space, next to the desk, stands a throwing target just like I have in my room. There\u2019 s a table and chairs in the corner , and his window faces Basgiath but is framed by thick black curtains with Fourth Wing\u2019s emblem on the bottom.\u201cWe do leadership meetings for the sections in here sometimes,\u201d he says from the doorway . I pivot to find him watching me with curious eyes, like he\u2019s waiting for me to pass judgment on his space. Walking past the sword rack, I let my fingers graze across the handles of the different daggers. \u201cHow many challenges have you won anyway?\u201d \u201cThe better question is how many have I lost,\u201d he says, coming in and closing the door behind him.",

Now sit.\u201d I pat the edge of his bed. \u201cWhat?\u201d His eyebrows rise. \u201cSit,\u201d I order , staring him down. \u201cI don\u2019 t want to talk about it.\u201d \u201cI never said you had to.\u201d There\u2019s no need to ask what it is, nor am I going to let what happened nearly six years ago drive a wedge between us, not even for one night. To my absolute surprise, he does as I ask, sitting on the side of his bed. His long legs stretch out in front of him, and he leans back slightly on the heels of his hands. \u201cNow what?\u201d I move between his thighs and run my fingers through his hair. He closes his eyes and leans into my touch, and I swear , I feel my heart crack wide open. \u201cNow I take care of you.\u201d His eyes fly open and gods, are they beautiful.",

  "\u201cI wasn\u2019 t going to go snooping through your clothes, and it\u2019 s not like I haven\u2019 t seen them all anyway .\u201d His gaze locks on my skirt, heating every time the slit reveals a section of my thigh. \u201cY ou\u2019ve been wearing that all night?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s what you get for walking behind me,\u201d I tease, coming to stand between his thighs again. \u201cI can\u2019t really argue about the view from the back, either .\u201d He tilts his chin to look up at me. \u201cBe quiet and let me get this off you.\u201d I undo the line of diagon al buttons across his chest, and he shrugs out of the leathers. \u201cWere you flying tonight?\u201d \u201cIt usually helps.\u201d He nods as I lean over to set them on the armchair . \u201cThis day is always\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry .\u201d I look him in the eyes as I say it, hoping he knows how very much I mean it as I return, reaching for his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d He lifts his arms, and I tug the shirt off before putting it with the flight jacket. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry about.\u201d I keep my eyes on his as I cup the unrelenting angles of his face, then trace the scar that bisects a brow . \u201cChallenge?\u201d \u201cSgaeyl.\u201d He shrugs.",
  "\u201cThreshing.\u201d \u201cMost dragons scar their riders , but Tairn and Andarna have never hurt me,\u201d I say absent-mindedly , my hand slipping down his neck.\u201cOr maybe they knew you already carried a scar.\u201d He trails his fingers down the long silver scar on my arm from Tynan\u2019 s blade. \u201cI wanted to fucking kill them. And instead, I had to stand there and watch them go at you three-on-one. I was at the edge of my control and ready to step in when Tairn landed.\u201d \u201cIt was only two-on-one once Jack ran,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019 t have interfered.",
  "It\u2019s against the rules, remember?\u201d But he took that step. That single step that told me he would have. A corner of his mouth quirks into one of the sexiest smirks I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cAt the end of the day, you walked away with two dragons.\u201d His expression falls. \u201cTwo weeks from now, I won\u2019 t even be here to watch when you\u2019re challenged, let alone do anything about it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I promise. \u201cWhom ever I can\u2019t beat in a challenge, I\u2019ll just poison.\u201d He doesn\u2019 t laugh. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d I lean in and kiss the scar on his eyebrow . \u201cIt will be tomorrow when you wake up.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d His arm curls around my hips and he tugs me closer . \u201cBut I\u2019m going to keep you all the same.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d I lean in and brush my lips over his. \u201cBecause I think I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d My heart beats erratically , and panic claws up my rib cage. I shouldn\u2019 t have said it. His eyes flare wide and his arms tighten around me. \u201cYou think? Or you know?\u201d Be brave. Even if he doesn\u2019 t feel the same , at least I will have spoken my truth.",
  "\u201cI know . I\u2019m so wildly in love with you that I can\u2019t imagine what my life would even look like without you in it. And I probably shouldn\u2019 t have said that, but if we\u2019re doing this, then we\u2019re starting from a place of complete honesty .\u201dHe crushes his mouth to mine and pulls me fully into his lap so I\u2019m straddling him. He kisses me so deep that I lose myself in it, in him. There are no words as he takes off my sash, my top, and unbuttons my skirt, all without breaking the kiss. \u201cStand,\u201d he says against my lips. \u201cXaden.\u201d My heart thunders. \u201cI fucking need you, Violet. Right now. And I don\u2019t need anyone , so I\u2019m not quite sure how to handle this feeling, but I\u2019m giving it my best. And if you don\u2019t want this tonight, that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019m going to need you to walk out that door right now, because if you don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to have you naked on your back in the next two minutes.\u201d The intensity in his eyes and the vehemence of his words should frighten me, but they don\u2019t. Even if this man loses every ounce of his self-control, I know he\u2019ll never hurt me. Not with his body , at least.",
  "\u201cWalk away or stay , but either way , I need you to stand up,\u201d he begs. \u201cI think two minutes might be overestimating your skills with a corset.\u201d I glance down at my armor .

T wo.\u201d I hold up my fingers. \u201cThree.\u201d He\u2019s on his feet in a heartbeat, and then his mouth is on mine, and I stop counting. I\u2019m too busy chasing the strokes of his tongue, feeling the ripple of his muscles beneath my fingertips, to give a shit where my clothes are going. I feel air rush against my legs as my skirt hits the floor , and I help him out by kicking of f my slippers while I suck on his tongue. He groans, his hands flying over my back. Laces loosen in record time, and the corset falls to the floor , leaving me in my underwear , since there wasn\u2019 t much else fitting underneath that dress uniform.Daggers, both his and mine, hit the ground as he unstraps the sheaths at my thighs and undoes his own.",
  "It\u2019s a glorious cacophony of metal until we\u2019re both naked and he\u2019 s kissing me breathless. Then his hands are in my hair, and pins fly until the mass falls down my back, unbound. He pulls back only long enough to rake his ravenous gaze down my body . \u201cSo fucking beautiful.\u201d \u201cI think that might have been a little longer than two\u2014\u201d I start, but he grabs the back of my thighs and lifts, sweeping my feet out from underneath me. My back hits the bed with a slight bounce, and honestly , I should have seen that move coming given that he\u2019s been putting me on my back for the better part of a year now . \u201cStill counting?\u201d he asks, dropping to his knees beside the bed and dragging me across the soft coverlet to the edge. \u201cDo you need me to keep score?\u201d I tease as my ass hits the end of the bed. \u201cFeel free.\u201d He grins, and before I can get another word in, his mouth is between my thighs. I suck in a sharp breath and throw my head back at the sheer pleasure of his tongue, licking and swirling around my clit. \u201cOh gods .\u201d \u201cWhich one are you calling out for?\u201d he asks against my flesh. \u201cBecause it\u2019s just you and me in this room, V i, and I don\u2019 t share.\u201d \u201cYou.\u201d My fingers tangle in his hair .",
  "\u201cI\u2019m calling out for you.\u201d \u201cI appreciate the elevation to deity, but my name will do.\u201d He licks me from entrance to clit, finally flicking his tongue over that sensitive bud, and I moan. \u201cFuck, you taste good. \u201d He lifts my thighs up onto his shoulders and settles in like he has nowhere else to be tonight. Then he absolutely devours me with tongue and teeth. Pleasure, hot and insistent, spirals in my stomach and I\u2019m lost in sensation, my hips rising and falling as I chase the high he drives me toward with every expert stab of his tongue.My thighs tremble when he takes up a rhythm against my clit and drives two fingers insid e me. They lock when he strokes his fingers in time with his tongue. Mindless, I\u2019m simply mindless. Power rushes through me in a deluge, mingling with the pleasure until they\u2019re one and the same, and when he tips me over the edge of oblivion, it\u2019s his name I scream as that power whips outward with every wave of my climax. Thunder booms, shaking the paneled glass in Xaden\u2019 s windows.",
  "\u201cThat\u2019 s one,\u201d he says, kissing his way up my limp body . \u201cThough I do think we\u2019re going to have to work on the fireworks show or people are always going to know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cYour mouth is\u2026\u201d I shake my head as his hands slide under me, moving us to the center of his bed. \u201cThere are no words for that.\u201d \u201cDelicious,\u201d he whispers, his lips skimming the plane of my stomach. \u201cYou are absolu tely delicious. I never should have waited this long to get my mouth on you.\u201d I gasp when he sucks the peak of my breast into his mouth, his tongue lashing and stroking my nipple as he works the other between thumb and forefinger , settin g a whole new fire within me built on the embers of the first. By the time he gets to my neck, I\u2019m a writhing flame beneath him, touching every part of him I can reach, stroking my hands down his arms, his back , his chest. Gods, this man is incredible, every line of him carved for battle and built by sparring and swordplay .",
  "Our mouths meet in a deep kiss, and I can taste us both in it as I draw my knees upward, settling his hips right where they\u2019re meant to be\u2014between my thighs. \u201cViolet,\u201d he groans, and I can feel the head of him at my entrance. \u201cI don\u2019t get equal time to play?\u201d I tease, arching my hips so he slides against me and making my own breath catch with the motion.He nips my lower lip. \u201cYou can play all you want later if I can have you right now .\u201d Yeah, that\u2019 s a plan I can get with. \u201cY ou already have me.\u201d His gaze collides with mine as he hovers above me, bracing his weight to keep from crushing me. \u201cY ou have everything I have to give.\u201d That\u2019 s enough\u2026for now . I nod, arching my hips again. Eyes locked with mine, he pushes into me with one long roll of his hips, consuming every inch and then taking another until he\u2019 s seated to the hilt. The pressure, the stretch, the fit of him is beyond words. \u201cYou feel so damn good.\u201d I roll my hips because I can\u2019 t help myself. \u201cI could say the same thing about you.\u201d He smiles, using my own words from earlier against me.",
  "Hard, deep, and slow, he sets a rhythm that has me arching for every thrust as we come together again and again and again. He drive s us up the bed, and I throw my arms back, bracing against the headboard for leverage as I meet every plunge of his hips. Gods, each is better than the last.",
  "When I urge him to move faster , he gives me a wicked grin and takes me at the same mind-blowing, heart-jolting pace. \u201cI want this to last. I need this to last.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m\u2026\u201d That fire in my core is coiled tight and so ready to burst free that I can almost taste how sweet it will be. \u201cI know .\u201d He drives forward again, and I whimper at how fucking good it feels. \u201cJust stay with me.\u201d He adjusts the angle so he hits my clit with every thrust and presses my knee forward, taking me even deeper . I\u2019m not going to survive this. I\u2019m going to die right here in this bed. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to die with you,\u201d he promises, kissing me. I\u2019m so far gone, I didn\u2019 t even realize I said the words out loud, and then I remember that I don\u2019t have to. \u201cMor e. I need more.\u201d Power simmers beneath my skin and my legs lock. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there. Fuck, you feel so damn good around me. I\u2019m never going to get enough of this, enough of you.\u201d\u201cI love you.\u201d The words are so incredibly freeing, even if he doesn\u2019t say them back.",
  "His eyes flare and his control snaps as he pounds into me , and that coiled pleasure explodes as my powers whip out again , cracking throug h the room , shattering like glass as he throw s his weight to the side , bringing me with him as he drives toward his own release , groaning into the side of my neck as the last waves of my or gasm leave me shuddering against him . Long minutes pass before our breathing steadies, and a light breeze kisses my thigh that\u2019s thrown over his. \u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d he asks, brushing my hair back from my face. \u201cI\u2019m great. Y ou\u2019re great. That was\u2026\u201d \u201cGreat?\u201d he supplies. \u201cExactly .\u201d \u201cI was going to use the word \u2018explosive,\u2019 but I think \u2018great\u2019 covers it.\u201d His fingers tangle in my hair. \u201cI fucking love your hair. If you ever want to bring me to my knees or win an argument, just let it down.",
  "I\u2019ll get the point.\u201d I grin as the breeze rustles through the brown-to-silver strands. Wait. There shouldn\u2019 t be a breeze.",
  "My stom ach drops as I push myself up on an elbow to look over Xaden\u2019 s shoulder . \u201cOh no, no, no.\u201d My hand covers my mouth as I glimpse the destruction. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I blew your window out.\u201d \u201cUnless there\u2019 s someone else throwing lightning around, then yeah, that was you. See what I mean? Explosive.\u201d He laughs. I gasp. That\u2019s why he threw himself sideways, to shield me from my own wreckage. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry .\u201d I scan over the damage, but there\u2019 s only sand on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to get that under control.\u201d \u201cI threw up a shield. Don\u2019 t worry about it.\u201d He pulls me back in for a kiss. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Repairing a window is on a whole differentlevel from replacing an armoire. \u201cRight now?\u201d He strokes my hair back from my face again. \u201cThat was two, if we\u2019re still counting, and I say we clean up, get the sand out of the bed, and get you to three, maybe four if you\u2019re still awake.\u201d My jaw drops. \u201cAfter I just shattered your window?\u201d He smiles and shrugs . \u201cI\u2019ve got us covered just in case you decide to take out the dresser next.\u201d I gaze down at his body , and the craving for him ignites again.",
  "How could it not when he looks like the gods blessed him and feels like the gods blessed me? \u201cYeah, let\u2019 s go for three.\u201d We\u2019re going for five, my hips in Xaden\u2019 s hands while I slowly ride him, when I trail my fingers down the black swirls of the relic on his neck. I\u2019m not sure how either of us is still moving, and yet we can\u2019t seem to stop tonight, can\u2019t get enough. \u201cIt really is beautiful,\u201d I tell him, rising up only to sink back down again, taking him deep within me. His dark eyes flare as his hands flex. \u201cI used to think of it as a curse, but now I realize it\u2019 s a gift.\u201d He arches his hips, hitting me at a sublime angle. \u201cA gift?\u201d Gods, he\u2019 s robbing me of every thought. Someone pounds on the door . \u201cGo the fuck away!\u201d Xaden snarls, reaching up my back and hooking onto my shoulder to pull me down into his next thrust.

Both Xaden and I startle, our gazes colliding in shock. I slide of f him, and Xaden covers me with his blank et before shoving his legs into his leathers and striding for the door .\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d he asks through a tiny opening in the door . \u201cGrab your flight leathers, and you\u2019d better bring Sorrengail with you, too,\u201d Garrick says. \u201cW e\u2019re under attack.\u201dThe inability to contr ol a powerful signet is just as danger ous to a rider\u2014and everyone in their vicinity\u2014as never manifesting one. \u2014M AJOR AFENDRA \u2019S GUIDE TO THE RIDERS QUADRANT (UNAUTHORIZED EDITION ) CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE I\u2019ve never gotten dressed so fast in my entire life, and I\u2019m not even bothering with the thigh sheaths . \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I ask Xaden, pulling on my formal dress and slippers and blowing my hair out of my face.",
  "Mandatory , urgent formation for the entire quadrant means now. The wards are falling. How many Navarrians are we going to lose?",
  "\u201cFour fifteen.\u201d He finishes lacing his boots, already armed to the teeth as I\u2019m picking up my sheaths, pretty sure I\u2019m missing one of them. \u201cYou\u2019re going to freeze out there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I drop to my knees and locate the missing dagger , hauling it out by the strap of the sheath before standing again. \u201cHere.\u201d Xaden throws one of his flight jackets over me, trapping my hair. \u201cIf Garrick\u2019 s right and we\u2019re under attack, then my guess is they\u2019ll order the older years to staff the mid-guard posts, so you shouldn\u2019 t be out in formation too long. I can\u2019 t stand the thought of you being cold.\u201d Which means he\u2019ll be leaving. My heart somersaults as I clumsily shove my arms through the sleeves of his jacket. He\u2019ll be safe, right? It will just be a midland assignment, and he\u2019s the most powerful rider in the quadrant. With my hands full of weapons, I don\u2019t argue about him buttoning the flight jacket over my chest.\u201cWe have to get to formation.\u201d His hands cradle my face. \u201cAnd if I have to go, then don\u2019t worry .

  "No one notices when I slip out of my wingleader \u2019s room and into the sea of riders, all tugging on their own clothes to get to formation. Everyone is running on adrenaline, too busy getting their shit together to notice what I\u2019m doing or the brief touch of Xaden\u2019 s hand against mine before he heads toward leadership gathered near the dais in the courtyard. I\u2019m not the only one still in my dress uniform, either . The wind has a bite to it as I make it into formation, but at least Xaden\u2019 s flight jacket keeps my hair tucked away . \u201cThis had better be good, becau se I was finally taking my shot with that gorgeous brunette healer ,\u201d Ridoc whines as he steps into formation behind me. Liam stands to my right, still buttoning the top on his uniform. \u201cGood night?\u201d I ask Liam. \u201cFine,\u201d he mutters, his cheeks turning pink in the moonlight. \u201cAnyone seen Dain?\u201d I ask Nadine as she steps into formation ahead of me. \u201cAll the squad leaders are with leadership,\u201d she answers over her shoulder as Rhiannon jogs up.

All three of them, which are considerably deeper than the ones in my own jacket.\u201cOh, I don\u2019 t know . Because it\u2019 s huge on you and there are three stars right here?\u201d She taps where there\u2019 s only one star on her uniform.",
  "Well, shit. Just goes to show that neither of us was thinking clearly . \u201cIt could be any third-year \u2019s.\u201d I shrug. \u201cWith a Fourth W ing shield on the shoulder?\u201d She cocks an eyebrow . \u201cThat does limit it a bit,\u201d I agree. \u201cAnd a wingleader emblem beneath those stars?\u201d she teases. \u201cFine, it\u2019s his,\u201d I whisper quickly as Commandant Panchek takes the dais, followed by Dain\u2019 s father and the wingleaders. Xaden\u2019 s damn good at keeping his eyes off me, but I can\u2019t say the same, especially when there\u2019 s little doubt he\u2019s about to be sent away and I can still feel his mouth on my skin. \u201cI knew it!\u201d Rhi grins. \u201cT ell me it\u2019 s good.\u201d \u201cI broke his window .\u201d I wince and my cheeks heat. \u201cLike\u2026you threw something at it?\u201d Her brow knits. \u201cNo. As in, lightning struck\u2026a lot, and I shattered his window .\u201d I glance toward the dais. \u201cAnd look, there he is now, all calm, cool, and collected.\u201d My chest tightens as I wonder which is the real version of him? The one standing up there, in complete control, ready to command his wing? Or the one I had inside me less than a half hour ago?",
  "The one who declared that he doesn\u2019 t deserve me but is going to keep me? Xaden looks anything but pleased, and his gaze locks with mine for a millisecond. \u201cFucking W ar Games.\u201d Relief and disbelief hit me in equal measure. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me.\u201d We got hauled out of bed for W ar Games? \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cDamn.\u201d Rhiannon grins. \u201cI wish someone made me shatter windows.\u201d I turn toward her , rolling my eyes. \u201cOh please, you\u2019ve had way more\u2014\u201d \u201cHey , Aetos,\u201d Rhiannon says, leaning on my shoulder and quickly draping her hand over my collarbone to hide Xaden\u2019 s insigni a and rank.\u201cGood morning, huh?\u201d Dain looks at Rhiannon like she\u2019s drunk too much mead as he approaches the squad. \u201cNot really , no.\u201d He glances over the rest of us. \u201cI know it\u2019s early\u2026or late, depending on your night, but we\u2019ve spent all year training for this, so wake the hell up.\u201d He turns to face the dais as Panchek takes the podium. \u201cThanks,\u201d I whisper to Rhianno n as she stands back at my side.

  "\u201cRiders Quadrant!\u201d Panchek shouts, his voice carrying across the courtyard. \u201cW elcome to the last event of this year \u2019s War Games.\u201d A murmur rips through the formation. \u201cThe alert that was sounded is similar to what it would have been if this were a real-life attack\u2014to see how fast you would muster\u2014and we will continue this exercise as if it is. Were the borders to be simultaneously attacked, and the wards falterin g, you would all be called into service to reinforce the wings. Colonel Aetos, would you do us the honor of reading the scenario?\u201d Dain\u2019 s dad steps forward, scroll in hand, and begins to read. \u201cThe moment we\u2019ve dreaded has arrived. The wards we\u2019ve dedicated our lives to upholding are falling, and there has been an unprecedented, multilevel attack along our borders, putting villages under siege from drifts of gryphon riders. Mass casualties among civilians and infantry are already being reported, as are the deaths of multiple riders.\u201d He\u2019s laying on the melodrama pretty thick. \u201cAs we would if you were a battle-ready force, we are sending your wings in every direction,\u201d he continues, focusing on each wing until coming to ours. \u201cFourth Wing to the southeast. Each squad will pick which outpost they will reinfor ce within that region.\u201d He holds up a finger .",
  "\u201cChoices are first come, first served. Wingleaders, however , will be assigned to theirs for the purposes of determining a headquarters for this exercise.\u201dHe turns to each wingleader , giving out orders, but glances in our direction\u2014no doubt looking for Dain\u2014before he turns toward Xaden. Something about the way his smile slips for a heartbeat makes the hair rise on the back of my neck. \u201cRiorson, you\u2019ll establish your headquarters for Fourth Wing at Athebyne. Wingleaders, assemble your headquarters squads at your own discretion, pulling from any and all riders within your wings.

  "Athebyne? That\u2019 s beyond the wards\u2026that\u2019 s where Xaden flew his secretive mission. My gaze seeks out his, but he\u2019 s focused on the colonel. \u201cFive whole days? This is going to be so much fun,\u201d Heaton exclaims with terrifying glee, running their hand over the purple flame s dyed into their hair . \u201cWe\u2019re going to pretend war .\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Imogen adds quietly . \u201cI think we are.\u201d \u201cJust like real life, you squad leaders need to make your choice s quickly , then report to the flight field within thirty minutes,\u201d Panchek decrees. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed.\u201d \u201cTairn.\u201d \u201cAlready moving.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to claim the outpo st at Eltuval, the northernmost one in our assigned region,\u201d Dain says, turning around to face us as Rhiannon leans over my shoulder again, blocking Xaden\u2019 s insignia. \u201cI\u2019m not getting stuck at some coastal outpost when we know that\u2019s not how Poro miel would choose to attack. Anyone have a problem with that?\u201d We all shake our heads. \u201cGood, then you heard the commandant. You have thirty minutes to change, pack what you can carry for five days, and get your asses to the flight field.\u201dFormation breaks and we all scurry to our dormitory rooms.",
  "\u201cWhat do you think our orders will be when we get there?\u201d Rhiannon asks as we force our way through the bottleneck of cadets all trying to get into the barracks. \u201cMore eggs to hunt?\u201d \u201cGuess we\u2019re about to find out.\u201d It takes ten minutes to wrap my knees and support my shoulders for a long flight, then dress in my own flight leathers. It takes another five minutes to detangle my hair from Xaden\u2019 s handling and braid it, which leaves me exact ly five to pack. I throw Xaden\u2019 s jacket in my rucksack just in case anyone snoops through my room while I\u2019m gone. \u201cWear every single dagger you own,\u201d Xaden demands, startling me. \u201cI\u2019m already wearing twelve.\u201d I continue throwing items into my overnight pack. \u201cGood.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the flight field, right?\u201d If he leaves without saying goodbye, I\u2019m going to track him down and kill him myself. \u201cYes.\u201d His reply is curt, but I finish packing and head out, meet ing Rhiannon and Liam in the hallway . A buzz of excitement accompan ies the crowd as we make our way to the flight field, takin g rations the kitchen staff hands out near comm ons on our way. No doubt we\u2019ll be eating breakfast midflight. When we arrive , it takes me a second to absorb the sight.",
  "Every dragon from the quadra nt fills the field, standing in the same formation we keep in the courtyard, and hundreds of mage lights float overhead like hovering stars, giving the space an otherw orldly feel, as though we\u2019re in a great hall instead of on the flight field. It\u2019 s beautiful and menacing at the same time. There\u2019 s a nervous mix of energy and anticipation and more than one person hurling up whatever they\u2019ve had to drink as the field floods with riders. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win,\u201d Rhiannon states as we make our way through thewings amid way too many snarling dragons and snapping teeth. We\u2019re not the only ones anxious tonight. \u201cWe\u2019re the best. We\u2019ll win.\u201d Her face is set in lines of determination. \u201cI can almost taste that squad leader designation for next year .\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll get it,\u201d I tell her, then turn toward Liam as we approach our section.",
  "\u201cWhat about you? Want to distinguish yourself with glory so you can rise to squad leader?\u201d He\u2019s a shoo-in with his hand-to-hand skills and stellar marks in classes. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He\u2019 s unusually tense as we keep walking. We make it to our dragons, and I can\u2019t help but notice that Tairn is standing in what should be Cath\u2019 s spot, forcing Dain\u2019 s dragon to the side as Dain does a head count. My egotistical dragon is already saddled with Andarna under his wing. Shit. They\u2019re going to force Andarna to keep up with us. \u201cAnd if we take enemy fire, then you find the first available cover and hide just like last scenario.",
  "You\u2019re too shiny for your own good,\u201d Tairn tells her. \u201cAll right.\u201d \u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d I ask Andarna, who struts out from under Tairn\u2019s wing with her head held high, boasting a contraption that reminds me of a saddle but isn\u2019 t. \u201cThe wingleader had it made for me. See? It hooks to T airn\u2019s.\u201d I can\u2019t help but smile as I see the shape of the triangle on Andar na\u2019s back that I\u2019m sure fits the one on T airn\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019 s amazing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just in case I can\u2019 t keep up. Now I can come along!\u201d Just another reason to adore Xaden. \u201cWell, I love it.\u201d I turn to Tairn, who\u2019 s busy snapping at Cath to give him more room. \u201cNeed me to attach anything?\u201d \u201cI have it handled.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d Then it hits me. Five days. Damn.",

We\u2019ll need to keep a tight formation for the first fifteen minutes as the squads disperse.\u201d He glances my way, then over my shoulder . \u201cWingleader?\u201d I pivot and see Xaden striding our way, the hilts of two swords strapped to his back rising above his shoulders, and my throat closes. How am I supposed to say goodbye to him in front of all these people? And worse, how are our dragons going to cope?",
  "\u201cDon\u2019 t worry , Silver One,\u201d Tairn interjects, his tone resolved. \u201cEverything is as it should be.\u201d \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Dain bites out, his shoulders straightening. \u201cI need you,\u201d Xaden says to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Dain retorts before I can even nod. \u201cRelax, he just wants to say goodbye,\u201d I explain. \u201cIf you\u2019re saying goodbye, it\u2019s to him,\u201d Xaden corrects, nodding at Dain. \u201cI\u2019m constructing my headquar ters squad and you\u2019re coming with me. So are Liam and Imogen.\u201d My jaw unhinges. I\u2019m what ? \u201cThe fuck you are,\u201d Dain barks, stepping forward. \u201cShe\u2019 s a first-year , and Athebyne is beyond the wards.\u201d Xaden blinks. \u201cI don\u2019t hear you giving me the same argument about Mairi.\u201d I look over my shoulder , and sure enough, Liam stands with his chin raised in front of Deigh. It\u2019 s almost as if he expected this.",
  "\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d I ask Xaden. \u201cLiam is the best cadet among the first-years, even with you assigning him guard duty over V iolet,\u201d Dain ar gues, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cAnd Sorrengail wields lightning,\u201d Xaden counters, taking a step closer so his arm brushes my shoulder . \u201cAnd not that I owe you an explanation,second-year , because I don\u2019t, but Sgaeyl and Tairn can\u2019t be separated for longer than a few days\u2014\u201d Of course. Now it makes sense. \u201cThat you know of!\u201d Dain excla ims. \u201cOr can you honestly tell me Sgaeyl was at her wit\u2019s end when you showed up at Montserrat? You\u2019ve never fully tested how long they can be apart.\u201d \u201cFeel like asking her yourself?\u201d Xaden quips, arching a brow . A low growl rumbles as Sgaeyl stalks forward, menace gleami ng in her eyes. My heart launches into my throat on Dain\u2019 s behalf. It doesn\u2019t matter how often I\u2019m around her\u2014there\u2019 s always a part of me that sees her as the death sentence she is.",
  "\u201cDon\u2019 t do this. Riders are known to die during War Games, and she\u2019s safer with me,\u201d Dain argues. \u201cAnything could happen once we\u2019re away from Basgiath, let alone you taking her beyond the wards.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not dignifying that with a response. This is an order .\u201d Dain\u2019 s eyes narrow . \u201cOr has this been your plan all along?

Do you know Tairn won\u2019 t survive your death? Or has it all been a ploy to earn your trust, V iolet?\u201d I suck in a sharp breath. \u201cY ou need to stop right now .\u201d \u201cPlease, do quit while you\u2019re behind, Aetos,\u201d Xaden seethes.",
  "\u201cYou want the truth? She\u2019s a fuck of a lot safer with me beyond the wards than she is with you within them. We both know it.\u201d The look in his eyes is similar to the one in Sgaeyl\u2019 s, and it dawns on me why she chose him. They\u2019re both ruthless, both willing to annihila te whatever stands between them and what they want. And Dain is in Xaden\u2019 s path.\u201cStop.\u201d I put my hand on Xaden \u2019s arm. \u201cXaden, stop. If you want me to go with you, I\u2019ll go. It\u2019 s that simple.\u201d His gaze shifts to meet mine and immediately softens. \u201cNo fucking way,\u201d Dain whispers, but it reverberates in my bones like a lightning strike. I pivot, dropping my hand from Xaden\u2019 s arm, but it\u2019s obvious by Dain\u2019 s expression that he now knows there\u2019 s something between Xaden and me\u2014 and he\u2019 s hurt. My stomach hits the ground. \u201cDain\u2026\u201d \u201cHim?\u201d Dain\u2019 s eyes widen and his face flushes. \u201cYou and\u2026 him?\u201d He shakes his head . \u201cPeople talk, and I thought that\u2019s all it was, but you\u2026\u201d Disappointment drops his shoul ders. \u201cDon\u2019t go, Violet. Please.",
  "He\u2019s going to get you killed.\u201d \u201cI know you think Xaden has ulterior motives, but I trust him. He\u2019s had every opportunity and has never hurt me.\u201d I move toward Dain. \u201cAt some point, you have to let this go.\u201d Dain looks horrified for a secon d but quickly masks it. \u201cIf he\u2019s what you choose\u2026\u201d He sighs. \u201cThen I guess that has to be enough for me, doesn\u2019 t it?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d I nod. Thank gods all this nonsense is about to be past us.",
  "He swallows hard and leans in to whisper , \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Violet.\u201d Then he pivots on his heel and heads for Cath. \u201cThank you for trusting me,\u201d Xaden says as I reach T airn\u2019s foreleg. \u201cAlways.\u201d \u201cWe have to ride.\u201d He pauses, like he\u2019s going to say more, but turns away instead. As he heads back to Sgaeyl , I can \u2019 t help but note both of the important men are walking away from me right now , in opposite directions , and given the one I \u2019 ve chosen to follow , my life is about to change forever .The first known gryphon attack occurr ed in 1 AU ( After Unification ) near what is now the trading post of Resson .",

  "There\u2019 s a pulling sensation in my chest, then a snap as we cross the barrier of the wards. \u201cIt feels differ ent,\u201d I tell T airn. \u201cWithout the wards, magic is wilder here. It\u2019s easier for dragons to communicate within the wards. The wingleader will have to take that into account when commanding his wing fr om this outpost.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sur e he\u2019s already thought of that.\u201d It\u2019s nearly one o\u2019clock in the afternoon when we approach Athebyne, stopping, at the orders of the dragons, at a lake closest to the outpost so they can drink. The surface of the lake is smooth as glass, reflecting the jaggedpeaks in front of us with breathtaking accuracy before the riot lands on the shoreline and sends ripples over the water in tiny shock waves. A thick forest of trees and heavy boulders surround one edge of the water , and nearby grass is trampled, which means we\u2019re not the first riot to rest here. There are ten dragons in all with us, and though I might not recognize each one of them, I know that Liam and I are the only first-years in the group. Deigh lands beside Tairn, and Liam jumps from his seat like we haven\u2019 t just spent seven hours in the sky .",
  "\u201cYou both need to drink and probably eat something,\u201d I tell them as I unbuckle from the saddle. My thighs are sore and cramping, but it\u2019s not quite as bad as it was at Montse rrat. The extra hours in the saddle this last month have helped. Tairn pops a talon onto a latch, and Andarna plops to the ground, shaking her head, body , then tail. \u201cAnd you need to sleep,\u201d Tairn replies. \u201cYou\u2019ve been up all night.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll sleep when you do.\u201d Navigating his spikes carefully , I slide down his foreleg to the mossy edge of the shore. \u201cI can go for days without sleep. I\u2019d rather you not fire off lightning bolts out of sleep deprivation.\u201d It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue to retort that it takes effort to wield lightning, but after I shattered Xaden\u2019 s window last night, I\u2019m not sure I have any expertise on the subject. Or maybe it\u2019s just Xaden who makes me lose control. Either way, I\u2019m danger ous to be around. I\u2019m surprised Carr hasn\u2019 t given up on me. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to be beyond the war ds,\u201d I say, changing the subject. Tairn\u2019s talons dig into the soil as Liam approaches, stretching his neck high above his shoulders.",
  "From the general agitation of the riot, I wonder if it\u2019s something they all feel, this wrongness in the air that has the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end.",
  "\u201cWe\u2019re twenty minutes out from Athebyne, so hydrate! We have no ideawhat kind of scenario is waiting for us,\u201d Xaden calls out, his voice carrying over the squad. \u201cYou doing all right?\u201d Liam asks, coming my way as Tairn and Andarna both take the few steps they need to access the water . \u201cStay with Tairn,\u201d I tell Andarna. She\u2019s a shiny target this far from the protection of the V ale. \u201cI will.\u201d Gods, I should have left her at Basgiath. What the hell was I thinking, bringing her out here? She\u2019 s just a kid, and this flight has been grueling. \u201cIt was never your choice,\u201d Tairn lectures. \u201cHumans, even bonded ones, do not decide wher e dragons fly. Even one as young as Andarna knows her own mind.\u201d His words bring little comfort. When push comes to shove, I\u2019m responsible for her safety . \u201cViolet?\u201d Concern furrows Liam\u2019 s brow . \u201cIf I say I\u2019m not sure, will you think less of me?\u201d There are so many ways to answer that question.

Naturally , the section leader made the cut for Xaden\u2019 s personal squad. Xaden looks my way, our eyes locking for a second, and that\u2019s all it takes to remind my body that I had him naked a few hours ago, the lines of his carved muscles straining agains t my skin. I\u2019m so damned in love with that man.",
  "How am I supposed to keep it of f my face? Just be professional. That\u2019s all I have to do.

Good thing he\u2019 s only my wingleader for another week or so. \u201cKeep looking at me like that and we\u2019ll be stopped longer than a half hour,\u201d he warns without looking at me. \u201cPromise?\u201d His gaze whips my way, and I swear I see him actually smile before turning back toward Garrick. \u201cYou doing all right with whatever is going on there?\u201d Liam asks, startling me. \u201cAnd if I tell you I\u2019m not sure?\u201d I give him the same answer , my lips curving. \u201cI\u2019d think you got yourself in over your head.\u201d The look on his face is anything but teasing now . \u201cFor someone who said he owes Xaden everything, that\u2019s not a glowing recommendation.\u201d I drop my pack to the ground and roll the tense muscles of my shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019 t turn into Dain on me.\u201d \u201cYou feeling all right?\u201d Xaden asks.",
  "\u201cFine. Just a little sor e.\u201d The last thing I want to be is a burden for him. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Liam grimaces. \u201cIt\u2019 s just that I know his priorities.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really sorry you got dragged along on my account,\u201d I say quietly so the others won\u2019 t hear. \u201cYou should be at one of the midland posts with Dain, not being hauled past the wards. Colonel Aetos is a fair man, but I have no doubt this assignment is meant to \u2018give the marked wingleader his due.\u2019\u201d I finish the last in a fair imitation of Dain\u2019 s dad, and Liam rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not scared, no one is hauling me, and believ e it or not, Violet, sometimes my orders actually don\u2019t revolve solely around you. I do have other skills, you know ,\u201d he teases with a grin, flashing a dimple as he hip- checks me. \u201cI\u2019ve never once forgotten how amazing you are, Liam.\u201d And I mean it.He coughs, and I gesture him of f. \u201cNow , I need a moment of privacy .\u201d He bows with a wave of a hand , as though introducing me to the forest behind us, and I head of f into their shadowy depths.",
  "When I return to the shore of the lake, Xaden walks away from Garrick and holds out his hand as he approaches. My eyeb rows rise.",
  "Is he\u2026 No. He wouldn\u2019 t. Not in front of the eight other cadets. He laces his fingers with mine. Guess he would. It\u2019s more than the touch of his skin that has my pulse leaping. He\u2019 s breaking his own rule. I glance pointedly toward where the others are gathered, all in various states of relaxation by the shore, but my hand tightens around his. \u201cNone of them is going to say a single word about you\u2014or us. I trust every single person here with my life,\u201d he says, leading me toward a cluster of boulders almost twice his height on the far side of the lake. \u201cPeople talk. Let them.\u201d I\u2019m not ashamed of loving him, and I can handle any mean-spirited gossip that comes my way . \u201cYou say that now.\u201d His jaw flexes. \u201cDid you get enough to drink? Or eat?\u201d \u201cI broug ht everything I needed in my pack. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d \u201cWorrying about you is ninety-nine percent of what I do.\u201d His thumb strokes the back of my hand. \u201cWhen we make it to the outpost, I want you to rest after we get our scenar io objective. Liam will stay while I most likely take the third-years out to patrol.\u201d \u201cI want to help,\u201d I immediately protest.",
  "Wasn\u2019t that why he brought me? For my lightnin g? Not that I\u2019m exactly winning any accuracy awards, but still. \u201cYou can, after you rest up. You have to be at full strength to wield that signet of yours, or you\u2019ll risk burning out. T airn is too powerful.\u201d He makes a decent point, but it doesn\u2019 t mean I have to like it.Once we\u2019re out of sight of the others, he backs me against the largest boulder and then lowers into a crouch before me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I run my fingers through his hair just because I can. The fact that I get to touch this man is absolutely mind-blo wing, and I plan on taking every advantage of the privilege while I can. \u201cYour legs are stiff.\u201d He starts at my calves, working the knots loose with his strong hands. \u201cI guess we can\u2019t really leave until the dragons are ready anywa y, right?\u201d His touch feels downright decadent. \u201cRight. We have another ten minutes or so.\u201d He flashes a wicked grin at me. Ten minutes. Considering we really have no idea what the rest of the day will bring, I\u2019m more than happy to grab ahold of what time we have.",
  "I groan as my muscles melt and my head falls back to rest on the boulder . \u201cThat hurts so wonderfully . Thank you.\u201d He laughs, making his way up to the tense muscles of my thighs. \u201cTrust me, my motives aren\u2019 t altruistic, Violence. I\u2019ll take any excuse I can get to put my hands on you.\u201d The scruff on his cheeks scrapes my palms as I slide my hands down the sides of his face to cup the back of his neck. \u201cThe feeling is more than mutual.\u201d His breathing changes when he reaches the top of my thighs, his fingers kneading my muscles into outright submission. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this morning.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d He looks up at me, the sunlight catching the gold specks in his eyes, and arches his scarre d brow . \u201cWe were in the middle of something, if you don\u2019t remember .\u201d A slow smile spreads across my face. \u201cOh, I remember .\u201d The top button of his flight jacket is undone, and I grip the fabric and tug him toward me.At what point is this constant craving for him going to be assuaged?",
  "I\u2019ve had him multip le times in the past twenty-four hours and could still go another round\u2026or three. \u201cIs it wrong to wish we\u2019d had time to finish?\u201d \u201cNot sure I\u2019ll ever be finished .\u201d He rises, every plane of his body caressing mine on the way up. \u201cI\u2019m way too fucking greedy when it comes to you.\u201d He slants his head over mine and blurs out the rest of the world with a slow, luxurious kiss. His tongue slides between my parted lips to glide against mine like he has absolutely no other plans for the day but to memorize every corner of my mouth. My entire body flares to life, then starts to simmer when he kisses a path down my throat. He palms my waist, pulling my curves flush with his hard angles, and I\u2019m nothing but heat and need. My heart pounds so hard, it sounds like wingbeats in my ears. Gods, I\u2019ll never get enough of this. He groans, one hand sliding to my ass.",

I\u2019ve already told him that I love him, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m keeping secrets over here. Hell, compared to him, I\u2019m an open book. \u201cImpossible to sate.\u201d His eyes darken. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep you,\u201d he promises, just like he did last night.",
  "Or was it this morning? \u201cY ou\u2019re mine, V iolet.\u201d I lift my chin. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re mine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been yours for longer than you could ever imagine.\u201d As if the words untether him, he clutches the nape of my neck and kisses me long and hard, stealing every breath, every thought beyond the sweep of his tongue and therising tide of need that heats my skin. Xaden yanks his mouth away with a gasp, breaking the kiss and cocking his head to the side as if listening for something. \u201cWhat\u2019 s wrong?\u201d I ask. He\u2019 s gone rigid beneath my arms. \u201cShit.\u201d His eyes widen as he drags his gaze back to mine. \u201cViolet, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d \u201cIs this seriously how you dragon riders spend your time?\u201d a woman asks from behind Xaden, her voice like velvet dragged over a gravel road. He spins around so quickly , he\u2019s a blur. Shadows envelop me, thick as a thundercloud. I can\u2019 t see shit. \u201cXaden!\u201d someone yells and multiple pairs of feet come crashing through the brush. Bodhi, maybe? \u201cSilly to hide what\u2019 s already been seen,\u201d the woman says, her tone curt.",
  "\u201cAnd if rumors are true, there\u2019 s only one silver -haired rider in your death factory of a college, which means that\u2019 s General Sorrengail\u2019 s youngest.\u201d \u201cFuck,\u201d Xaden swears. \u201cI need you to stay calm, V iolence.\u201d Calm? Shadows fall away , and I leave my hands loose at my sides in case I need to grab a dagger or wield, sidestepping Xaden so I can see. A pair of gryphon riders stands in the meadow about thirty feet away , their beasts eerily silent behind them. They\u2019re a third of the size of our dragons, but those beaks and claws look capable of shredding skin and scale just the same. \u201cTairn!\u201d \u201cComing.\u201d \u201cStay with Sgaeyl,\u201d I order Andarna. \u201cThe gryphons look tasty fr om her e,\u201d she responds. \u201cThey\u2019r e the same size you ar e. No.\u201d \u201cA fucking Sorrengail.\u201d The woman looks only a few years older than me, but she has the look of a veteran rider. She arches a dark brow, lookingat me like I\u2019m something that needs to be shoveled out of the horse stalls. The sound of beating wings fills the air as a handful of dragon riders barrel into the space around us.",
  "Imogen. Bodhi. A third-year with a scarred lip I recognize. Liam. But no one is reaching for a weapon. At least the odds are in our favor now. Power unfurls under my skin, and I throw open that Archives door, letting energy rush over me in a torrent of scalding heat. The sky crackles. \u201cNo!\u201d Xaden turns and hauls me against his chest, wrapping his arms around me and pinning my arms to my sides. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I throw my weight against Xaden, but it\u2019s no use. He has me locked down tight. A gust of wind hits my right side as T airn lands. \u201cHoly shit, that one is huge ,\u201d the woman says. Around Xaden\u2019 s immovable arm, I see the gryphon riders retreat with quick steps, their eyes flying wide as they look up. Xaden lifts one hand to cup the nape of my neck as I look up at him. What the actual fuck is he doing?",
  "Kissing me before we die? \u201cIf you have ever trusted me, Violet, I need you to do it now.\u201d The plea in his eyes leaves me stunned. Our enemies are feet away and he wants to\u2026have a moment ? \u201cJust stay here. Stay calm.\u201d His eyes search mine for an answer to a question I haven\u2019 t been asked. Then he passes me to Liam. Passes me. Like I\u2019m a damned rucksack. Liam pins my arms to my sides with careful but unyielding strength. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this, V iolet.\u201d Why the hell is everyone apologizing? \u201cLet. Me. Go,\u201d I demand as Xaden strides toward the pair of gryphon riders, Garrick at his side. Fear squeezes my heart like a vise that he thinks he can take on the gryphons and their riders himself. \u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d Liam apologizes, his voice lowering. \u201cI really wish I could.\u201dTairn roars from my right so hard that spit flies, smacking Liam in the face and making my ears ring. Liam drops his hands and backs away slowly , putting his palms up. \u201cGot it. Point made. No touching.\u201d Free from his grip, I spin toward the field as Xaden reaches the riders. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking early ,\u201d he says.",
  "And my heart stops.In his last days of interr ogation, Fen Riorson lost touch with r eality , railing against the kingdom of Navarr e. He accused King T auri, and all who came befor e him, of a conspiracy so vast, so unspeakable, that it does not bear r epeating by this historian. The execution was swift and mer ciful for a madman who cost untold lives. \u2014N AVARRE , AN UNEDITED HISTORY BY COLONEL LEWIS MARKHAM CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE Somehow , I manage to keep breathing, which is impressive given my heart feels like it might shatter in a million pieces, and narrow my gaze on the enemy . I\u2019ve never seen a gryphon rider before. The dragons usually burn them to ash, along with their half-eagle, half-lion mounts. \u201cWhat happened to meeting tomorrow? We don\u2019t have a full shipment,\u201d Xaden says to the gryphon rider , his voice calm and even. \u201cThe shipment isn\u2019t the issue,\u201d the woman says, shaking her head. Unlike our black, the riders\u2019 leathers are brown, matching the darker feathers of their beasts\u2026who are currently staring at me like I\u2019m dinner . \u201cIf they try anything, they\u2019ll be a snack,\u201d Tairn says. Shipment.",
  "I barely proce ss what Tairn says through the shock of the rider \u2019s words. And Xaden knows them. He\u2019s working with them, aidin g our enemy . Betrayal cuts my throat like glass as I try to swallow . This is why he\u2019s been sneaking of f from the quadrant. \u201cSo you were waiting nearby to chat on the off chance that we\u2019d fly by a full day early?\u201d Xaden asks. \u201cWe were patrolling from Draithus yesterday\u2014it\u2019 s about an hoursoutheast from here\u2014\u201d \u201cI know where Draithus is,\u201d Xaden retorts. \u201cNever know , you Navarrians act like nothing exists beyond your borders,\u201d the male gryphon rider snarks. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019re bothering to warn them.\u201d \u201cWarn us?\u201d Xaden\u2019 s head cocks to the side. \u201cWe lost a village in the vicinity to a horde of venin two days ago. They decimated everything.\u201d I startle, my eyes flying wide. She just said what ? \u201cVenin never come this far west,\u201d Imogen says from my left. Venin. Yep, that\u2019s what they both said. What the actual hell? I\u2019d think someone was fucking with me if not for the two enormou s gryphons looming behind the pair of riders. But no one is laughing.",
  "\u201cUntil now,\u201d the woman replies, turning her gaze back to Xaden. \u201cThey were unmistakably venin and had one of their\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t say anything else,\u201d Xaden interrupts. \u201cYou know that none of us can know the details or we put everything at risk. All it takes is one of us being interrogated. \u201d \u201c Are you getting this ? \u201d I ask Tairn , glancing left and right to see if anyone else noticed the pure ridiculousness spewing from the woman \u2019 s mouth , but everyone else looks\u2026horrified , like they actuall y believe a village was destroyed by mythical creatures .",
  "\u201cUnfortunately , yes.\u201d \u201cDetails or not, it looks like the horde is heading north,\u201d the male says. \u201cStraight toward our trading post on the border across from your garrison at Athebyne. Are you armed?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re armed,\u201d Xaden admits. \u201cThen our job here is done. You\u2019ve been warned,\u201d the male says. \u201cNow we have to go defend our people. As it is, this side trip only gives us about an hour to reach them in time.\u201dInstantly , the atmosphere changes, intensifies, and the riders around me seem to brace for something. Xaden looks over his shoulder at me, and instead of laughing at the utter absurdity of what they\u2019re discussing, his face is set in grim lines. \u201cIf you think you\u2019ll ever convince a Sorrengail to risk their neck for anyone outside their own borders, then you\u2019re a fool,\u201d the man says with a sneer in my direction. Power sizzles painfully beneath my skin, demanding an outlet. The man leans slightly to the side and looks me up and down in obvious judgment. \u201cI wonder what your king would be willing to pay in order to get back the daughter of his most illustrious general. I\u2019m willing to bet your ransom would be worth enough weaponry to defend all of Draithus for a decade.\u201d Ransom?",
  "Oh, I think not. Tairn snarls. \u201cFuck,\u201d Bodhi mutters, moving closer to me. \u201cTry. I dare you.\u201d I crook my fingers at them, releasing just enough power that light flashes within the clouds above us. Shadows race menacingly from the pine trees on the edge of the meadow as Xaden raises his hands at his sides, and both gryphon riders tense when the darkness pauses only inches from their feet. \u201cYou take a step toward that Sorrengail and you\u2019ll be dead before you can even shift your weight,\u201d Xaden says, his voice dropping lethally . \u201cShe\u2019 s not up for discussion.\u201d The wom an glances at the shadows, then sighs. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there with the rest of our drift. Just signal if you can get away from the disbel ievers.\u201d She walks away , leading the man back toward their gryphons. They mount within seconds and launch skyward. Every head turns toward me with looks that vary from expectation to something akin to fear, and my stomach sinks. No one was surprised at the gryphon riders\u2019 familiarity or throwing words like \u201cvenin\u201d around. Andthey all knew Xaden was aiding the enemy . I\u2019m the outsider here.",
  "\u201cGood luck, Riorson.\u201d Imogen tucks a piece of her pink hair behind her ear, her rebellion relic peeking out above the sleeve of her flight leathers as she turns to give us space. My stom ach drops and my mind races, grasping for anythin g but the obvious, devasta ting truth as they all slowly follow Imogen back toward the lake.",
  "There\u2019 s a rebellion relic winding up a third-year \u2019s forearm as he passes in front of me. Garrick\u2019 s here. He\u2019s a section leader , but he\u2019s\u2026here, not with any of the Flame Section squads. So are Bodhi and Imogen. That brunett e rider with the nose ring is Soleil, I think, and that\u2019s definitely a relic on her left forearm. The second-year from Claw Section? He has one, too. And Liam\u2026Liam is at my side. \u201cTairn.\u201d I keep my breat hing as even as possible as Xaden stares at me, his face masked like an emotionless wingleader . \u201cSilver One?\u201d Tairn\u2019s giant head swings in my direction. \u201cThey all carry rebellion relics,\u201d I tell him. \u201cEveryone in this squad besides me is the child of a separatist.\u201d In the chaos of the flight field, Xaden constructed an all-marked squad. And they\u2019re all. Fucking. T raitors.",
  "And I fell for it. I fell for him. \u201cYes. They ar e,\u201d he agrees, resignation in his tone. My chest threatens to cave in as it truly hits me. This is so much worse than just Xaden betraying me, betraying our entire kingdom. There\u2019 s only one explanation as to why my own dragons have been so damned docile in the presence of the enemy . \u201cYou and Andarna lied to me, too.\u201d The treachery of it is too much, andmy shoulders dip from the weight of it. \u201cYou knew what he was doing.\u201d \u201cWe both chose you,\u201d Andarna says, like that makes it any better . \u201cBut you knew .\u201d I look past where Liam dares to stare at me with sorrow , to Tairn, whose lethal focus lies straight ahead like he hasn\u2019 t quite decided if he\u2019 s going to burn Xaden alive or not. \u201cDragons are bound by bond s,\u201d he explains as Xaden approaches. \u201cTher e is only one other bond more sacred than that of a dragon and its rider .\u201d A dragon and its mate. Everyone knew but me. Even my own dragons. Oh gods, is Dain right? Has everything Xaden\u2019 s done been a ploy to earn my trust?",
  "The sweet glow of happiness, of love, trust, and affection that burned so brightly in my chest just a few minutes ago sputters painfully , gasping for oxygen like a campfire put out by a bucket of water once it outlives its usefulness. All I can do is watch as the embers drown and die. Xaden watches me with increasing apprehension the closer he comes, like I\u2019m some kind of cornered animal about to fight her way out with teeth and claws. How was I ever foolish enough to trust him? How did I ever fall for him? My lungs ache and my heart screams. This can\u2019t be happening. I can\u2019t be this naive. But I guess I am, because here we are. His entire body is a fucking warning , especially the dark relic that\u2019s so glaringly visible on his neck right now. His father may have been the Great Betrayer , may have cost my brother his life, but Xaden\u2019 s treachery cuts just as deep. He flinches as my eyes narrow into a glare. \u201cWere we ever really friends?\u201d I whisper at Liam, searchin g for the strength to yell. \u201cWe are friends, Violet, but I owe him everything,\u201d Liam answers, and when I glance up, he\u2019s watching me with so much misery that I almost feel sorry for him.",
  "Almost. \u201cWe all do. And once you give him a chance toexplain\u2014\u201d There it is. Anger rushes to my aid, overpowering the hurt. \u201cYou watched me train with him!\u201d I shove at Liam\u2019 s chest, and he stumbles backward through the grass. \u201cYou stood by and watched me fall for him!\u201d \u201cOh shit.\u201d Bodhi laces his hands behind his thick neck. \u201cViolence, let me explain,\u201d Xaden says. He\u2019s always known my true nature, and honestly , the shado ws should have clued me in to his. He\u2019s a master of secrets. Unspent power ripples in my very bones as I turn my back on Liam to face Xaden. \u201cIf you even think about touching me, I swear I\u2019ll fucking kill you.\u201d My powe r flares with my rage and lightning cracks across the sky, jumping from cloud to cloud. \u201cI think she means it,\u201d Liam warns. \u201cI know she does.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s jaw ticks as our gazes collide and hold. \u201cEverybody , go back to the shore. Now .\u201d He watches me with apprehension as he draws closer . \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Xaden says in that deceptively soft voice of his, and there\u2019 s a flicker of fear in those onyx depths. \u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d Fucking.",
  "T raitor . \u201cYou\u2019re thinking I\u2019ve betrayed our kingdom.\u201d \u201cLogical guess. Good for you.\u201d Another bolt of lightning whips free, streaking cloud to cloud. \u201cYou\u2019re working with gryphon riders?\u201d I leave my arms loose at my sides just in case I need my hands free to wield, though I know I\u2019m no match for him. Not yet. \u201cGods, you are such a clich\u00e9, Xaden. You\u2019re a villain hiding in plain fucking sight.\u201d He winc es. \u201cActually , they\u2019re called fliers,\u201d Xaden says softly , holding my gaze. \u201cAnd I might be the villain to some, but not you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry? Are we seriously ar guing the semantics of your treason?\u201d \u201cDragons have riders, and gryphons have fliers .\u201d\u201cWhich you know because you\u2019re in league with them.\u201d I retreat a few steps so I don\u2019t act on the overwhelming urge to punch him in the face. \u201cYou\u2019re working with our enemy .\u201d \u201cDid you ever once stop to think that sometimes you can start out on the right side of a war and end up on the wrong one?\u201d \u201cIn this particular case? No.\u201d I point toward the shore. \u201cI was trained as a scribe, remember?",
  "All we\u2019ve done is defend our borders for six hundred years. They\u2019re the ones who won\u2019 t accept peace as a solution. What shipments have you been giving them?\u201d \u201cWeapons.\u201d My stomach hits the ground. \u201cThat they use to kill dragon riders?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head emph atically . \u201cThese weapons are only to fight venin.\u201d My jaw unhinge s. \u201cVenin are the stuff of fables. Like the book my father \u2014\u201d I blink. The letter . What had he written? Folklor e is passed from one generation to the next to teach us about our past. Was he trying to say\u2026 No.",
  "That\u2019 s impossible. \u201cThey\u2019re real,\u201d Xaden says softly , like he\u2019 s trying to lessen a blow . \u201cYou\u2019re saying people who can somehow tap into the source of magic without a dragon or gryphon to channel, corrupting their power beyond all salvation, actual ly exist.\u201d I say the words slowly just so we\u2019re crystal clear . \u201cThey\u2019re not just part of the creation fable.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d His forehead creases. \u201cThey drained all the magic out of the Barrens and then spread like an infestation.\u201d \u201cWell, at least that\u2019s in keeping with folklore.\u201d I fold my arms across my chest. \u201cWhat was the fable again? One brother bonded to gryphon, one to dragon, and when the third grew jealous, he drew directly from the source, losing his soul and waging war on the other two.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d He sighs. \u201cThis was not how I wanted to tell you.\u201d \u201cAssuming you were ever going to tell me!\u201d I glance to where Tairnwatches, his head low as though he might have to incinerate Xaden at any moment. \u201cCare to add to the discussion?\u201d \u201cNot yet. I\u2019d prefer you come to your own conclusion. I chose you for your intelligence and courage, Silver One. Don\u2019 t let me down.\u201d I barely restrain myself from flipping the middle finger at my own dragon. \u201cFine.",
  "W ere I to believe venin exist and roam the Continent wielding dark magic, then I\u2019d also have to believe they never attack Navarre because\u2026\u201d My eyes widen at the possibilit y\u2019s logical conclusion. \u201cBecaus e our wards make all non-dragon magic impossible.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d He shifts his weight. \u201cThey\u2019d be powerless the second they cross into Navarre.\u201d Fuck, that makes sense, and I desperately don\u2019t want it to. \u201cWhich means I would have to believe that we have no clue that Poromiel is being relentlessly , viciously attacked by dark wielders just beyond our borders.\u201d My brow furrows. He glances away and takes a deep breath before looking me in the eye. \u201cOr you have to believe that we know and choose to do nothing about it.\u201d Indignation lifts my chin. \u201cWhy the hell would we choose to do nothing about people being slaughtered? It goes against everything we stand for .\u201d \u201cBecause the only thing that kills venin is the very thing powering our wards.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say anything else as we stand there, the only sound the water lapping against the shore in time with the echo of his words beating against the edges of my heart. \u201cIs this why there have been raids along our borders? They\u2019re looking for the material we use to power our wards?\u201d I ask.",
  "Not because I believe him, not yet, but because he\u2019s not trying to convince me. The truth rarely needs effort , my dad used to say . He nods. \u201cThe material is forged into weapons to fight the venin. Here,take this.\u201d Raising his right arm, he takes a black-handled dagger from the sheath at his side. I\u2019m brutally aware of every move, horrifyingly aware that he\u2019s been able to kill me whenever he wants, and this moment is no different. Though it would have been a swifter death if he\u2019d simply used one of the swords strapped across his back . He moves slowly , extending the dagger as an of fering. I take it, noting the sharpened blade, but it\u2019s the alloy embedde d into the rune-marked hilt that makes me gasp. \u201cYou took this from my mother \u2019s desk?\u201d My gaze jumps to his. \u201cNo. Your mother probably has one for the same reason you should.",
  "To defend against venin.\u201d There\u2019 s so much pity in his eyes that my chest tightens. The dagger . The raids. It\u2019 s all right there. \u201cBut you told me there was no chance we could be fighting something like this,\u201d I whisper , clinging to the last of my hope that this is all a horrible joke. \u201cNo.\u201d He moves closer , reaching for me and then dropping his hand as if he\u2019s thought better of it. \u201cI told you I would hope that if this threat was out there, our leadership would tell us.\u201d \u201cYou twisted the truth to suit your needs.\u201d My hand curls around the dagger \u2019s hilt, and I feel it hum with power . Venin are real. V enin. Are. Real. \u201cYes. And I could lie to you, Violence, but I\u2019m not. No matter what you think right now , I have never lied to you.\u201d Sure.",
  "Right. \u201cAnd how do I know this is the truth?\u201d \u201cBecause it hurts to think we\u2019re the kind of kingdom that would do this. It hurts to rearrange everything you think you know . Lies are comforting. Truth is painful.\u201d I feel the hum of power within the blade and glare at Xaden. \u201cYou could have told me at any time, but instead you hid everything from me.\u201dHe flinches. \u201cYes. I should have told you months ago, but I couldn\u2019 t. I\u2019m risking everything by telling you now\u2014\u201d \u201cBecause you have to, not because you want\u2014\u201d \u201cBecause if your best friend sees this memory , everything is lost,\u201d he interrupts, and I gasp. \u201cYou don\u2019 t know that\u2014\u201d \u201cDain wouldn\u2019 t break a rule to save your life, Violet. What do you think he\u2019d do if he had this knowledge?\u201d What would Dain do? \u201cI have to believe he would not put the Codex above people suffering beyond our borders. Or maybe I could have built shields that would have kept Dain from prying. Or maybe he would continue to respect my bounda ries and never look in the first place.\u201d I narrow my eyes. \u201cBut we\u2019ll never know , will we?",
  "Because you didn\u2019 t trust me to know the right thing to do, Xaden, did you?\u201d He throws his hands wide. \u201cThis is bigger than you and me, Violence. And leadership will stop at nothing to sit behind their wards and keep the venin secret.\u201d His voice is raw as he pleads, \u201cI watched my own father executed trying to help these people. I couldn\u2019 t risk you, too.\u201d He leans into my space a little more with every word, launching my pulse, but I\u2019m done letting my heart make my head\u2019 s choices. \u201cY ou love me, and\u2014\u201d \u201cLoved,\u201d I correct him, sidestepping so I can get some fucking space and then taking it. \u201cLove!\u201d he shouts, stopping me in my tracks and earning us a glance from every rider within hearing distance. \u201cY ou love me.\u201d One of those little embers in my chest tries to come back to life, and I squash it before it has the chance to burn. Slowly , I turn to face him. \u201cEverything I feel\u2014\u201d I swallow , fighting to hold on to the anger so I don\u2019t fall apart. \u201cFelt for you was based on secrets and deception.\u201d Shame burns in my cheeks that I was naive enough to fall for him in the first place.\u201cEverything between us is real, Violence.\u201d The intensity with which he says it hurts my heart even more.",
  "\u201cThe rest, I can explain with enough time. But before we get to our assign ed outpost, I need to know if you believe me.\u201d I glance at the dagger and hear the words in my father \u2019s letter as surely as if he\u2019d spoken them. I know you\u2019ll make the right choice when the time comes.",
  "He warned me the only way he could have: through books. \u201cYes,\u201d I say, handing the dagger back to Xaden. \u201cI believe you. That doesn\u2019 t mean I trust you anymore.\u201d \u201cKeep it.\u201d His posture softens in relief. I sheathe it at my thigh. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me a weapon after just telling me that you\u2019ve been deceiving me for months, Riorson?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely . I have another , and if what the fliers say is true, and venin are headed north, then you might need it. I never lied when I said I can\u2019t live without you, Violence.\u201d He backs away slowly , his lips curving in a sad smile. \u201cAnd defenseless women have never been my type, remember?\u201d I\u2019m not remotely ready to joke around with him. \u201cLet\u2019 s just get to Athebyne.\u201d He nods, and a few minutes later , we\u2019re midflight. \u201cWe know we didn\u2019t lie. We just didn\u2019 t tell you everything,\u201d Andarna says, flying in the pocket of air behin d Tairn with the least wind resistance as we make our way to the outpost. \u201cThat\u2019 s lying by omission,\u201d I argue.",
  "There\u2019 s a lot of that going around today . \u201cShe\u2019 s right, Golden One.\u201d Tension radiates through every line of Tairn\u2019s body and the very beats of his wings. \u201cYou have every right to be angry .\u201d He banks, following the mounta in range along the border . The straps on my saddle bite into my thighs.",
  "\u201cWe made a choice to protect you\u2014without your consent. It was an error, and one that I won\u2019 t make again.\u201d The guilt he feels overwhelms my own emotions, melting the hottest of my anger , and Ibegin to think. Really , truly think. If venin exist, we\u2019d have record. And yet there weren\u2019 t any copies of The Fables of the Barren in the Archive s\u2014the one location Navarre should have a copy of every book written or transcribed in the last four hundred years, which means Dad didn\u2019 t just give me a rare book\u2026but a forbidden one. Four hundred years of tomes and not a single one\u2014 Four hundred years. But our history spans over six. Everything is a copy of an earlier work. The only original text in the Archives older than four hundred years\u2014around the time we fell into war with Poromiel\u2014are the original scrolls from the Unification over six hundred years ago. It only takes one desperate generation to change history\u2014even erase it. Gods, Dad spelled it all out for me. He\u2019d always told me scribe s hold all the power . \u201cYes,\u201d Tairn says as we curve around the last peak, its jagged top bare of snow from the summer heat, and the mountainside outpost of Athebyne comes into view at the same time as the Cliffs of Dralor .",
  "\u201cOne generation to change the text. One generation chooses to teach that text. The next grows, and the lie becomes history .\u201d He banks left, following the curve of the mountain, then slows as we approach the outpost\u2019 s flight field. My hands grip the pommels when we land in front of the looming structure perched on the side of the last peak in this range. Its design is identical to Montserrat, a simple square fortress with four towe rs and walls barely thick enough to launch a dragon. The military is nothing if not uniform. I unbuck le from my saddle and slide down his foreleg. \u201cAnd somehow we\u2019re supposed to be able to concentrate on the War Games,\u201d I mutter , adjusting my pack on my shoulders, thinking about a trading post that mayor may not be under attack from mythical creatures soon. The others dism ount, and I look back to see Andarna already curled up between T airn\u2019s feet. Xaden walks with Garrick, looking my way with what feels like longing.",
  "I gave him everything, and he never truly let me in. Pain rips through my chest with the kind of cut that only heartbreak can give, sharp and jagged. I imagine this is what it feels like to be cleaved apart with a dull, rust-covered blade. It\u2019s not honed enough to slice quickly , and there\u2019 s a one hundred percent chance the wound is going to fester . If I can\u2019t trust him, there\u2019 s no future for us. It\u2019s more than tense as the ten of us walk beneath the open portcullis and into the outpost. The very empty outpost. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Garrick strides across the courtyard in the center of the structure, lookin g along the gathering spaces that should line the interior just like Montserrat. \u201cStop,\u201d Xaden orders, surveying the walls that rise on every side above us. \u201cThere\u2019 s no one here. Divide and search.\u201d He glances at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t leave my side. I don\u2019 t think this is a W ar Game.\u201d I start to argue that he couldn\u2019 t possibly know that, but the whip of wind through the open gate makes me pause. The only sounds in a fortress that should house more than two hundred people are our footsteps on the rocky ground\u2014and he\u2019 s right. Everything feels off.",
  "\u201cAwesome,\u201d I reply with more than a small dose of sarcasm, and everyone but Liam\u2014who\u2019 s my shadow once again\u2014scatters in groups of two or three, climbing various staircases. \u201cThis way,\u201d Xaden says, beelini ng for the southwest tower . We climb and climb, finally reaching the top of the fourth floor , where the door leads us to an open-air observation point that overlooks the valley below , including the Poromish trading post. \u201cThis is one of the most strategic garrisons we man,\u201d I say, looking forany sight of the infantry and riders who should be here. \u201cThe re\u2019s no way they\u2019d abandon it for W ar Games.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s exactly what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d Xaden looks out over the valley , then narrows his eyes on the trading post a thousand feet below . \u201cLiam.\u201d \u201cOn it.\u201d Liam moves forward, leaning on the stone battlement as he focuses on the structures in the distance beneath us. The trading post is maybe a twenty-minute walk along the wide gravelly path winding down the mountainside our outpost is perched on. The roofs of several buildings just poke out above the circular stone wall of its defenses, a drift of gryphons and their fliers approaching from the south.",
  "Xaden turns on me, and the look in his eyes is anything but welcoming. \u201cWhat did Dain say to you before we left? He leaned in and whispered something.\u201d I blink, trying to remember . \u201cHe said something like\u2026\u201d I search my memory . \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, V iolet.\u201d His body goes tense. \u201cAnd he said I was going to get you killed.\u201d \u201cYes, but he always says that.\u201d I shrug. \u201cWhat would Dain have to do with emptying an entire outpost?\u201d \u201cI have something!\u201d Garrick calls from the southeast tower , holding what looks to be an envelope as he and Imogen cross the thick rampart, coming in our direction.",
  "\u201cDid you tell him about my trips here?\u201d Xaden questions, his eyes hardening. \u201cNo!\u201d I shake my head. \u201cUnlike some people, I never hid anything from you.\u201d He draws back, his gaze shifting left and right as he thinks before settling on me again and widening. \u201cViolence,\u201d he says softly , \u201cdid Aetos touch you after I told you about Athebyne?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d My brow furrows, and I shove an errant strand of hair out of my face as the wind swirls around us.\u201cLike this.\u201d He lifts his hand to my cheek. \u201cHis power requires touching someone\u2019 s face. Did he touch you like this?\u201d My lips part. \u201cYes, but that\u2019s how he always touches me. He would n- never\u2026\u201d I sputter . \u201cI would know if he read my memories.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s face falls, and his hand slips downward, cradling the back of my neck. \u201cNo, Violence. Trust me, you wouldn\u2019 t.\u201d There\u2019 s no accus ation in his tone, just a resignation that hurts what\u2019 s left of my heart. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019 t.\u201d I shake my head. Dain is a lot of things, but he would never violate me like that, never take something I hadn\u2019 t offered. Except he tried once.",
  "\u201cIt\u2019s addressed to you,\u201d Garrick says, handing the envelope to Xaden. Xaden drops his hand from my face and breaks the seal. I can read the lettering as he opens the missive. War Games for Xaden Riorson, W ingleader of Fourth W ing. I recogn ize the handwriting\u2014how could I not when I\u2019ve seen it all my life? \u201cThat\u2019 s from Colonel Aetos.\u201d \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Garrick asks, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019 s our assignment?\u201d \u201cGuys, I see something just past the trading post,\u201d Liam says from the battlement. \u201cOh shit.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s face drains of all color , and he crumples the missive in his fist before looking at me. \u201cIt says our mission is to survive if we can.\u201d Oh gods .",
  "Dain read my memories without my permission. He must have told his father to where they\u2019ve been sneaking off. I\u2019ve unknowingly betrayed Xaden\u2026betrayed them all. \u201cThat\u2019 s not\u2026\u201d Garrick shakes his head. \u201cGuys, this is bad,\u201d Liam shouts, and Imogen races to his side. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Xaden says to me, then rips his gaze from mine and turns to his friends, who are running down the ramparts to join us. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sent here to die.\u201dFor ther e, in the land beyond the shadows, wer e monsters that dwelled in the night and dined on the souls of childr en who wander ed too close to the woods. \u2014\u201cT HE WYVERN \u2019S CRY,\u201d T HE FABLES OF THE BARREN CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX Xaden hands Garrick the missiv e, and the rest of us rush to the battlements to see what we\u2019re up against, but I can\u2019t spot any threat in the valley below or the plains that stretch beyond for miles before the Clif fs of Dralor . \u201cSomething is off,\u201d Tairn says. \u201cI felt it at the lake, but it\u2019s stronger here.\u201d \u201cCan you pinpoint what it is?\u201d I reply as panic creeps up my throat.",
  "If Dain\u2019 s dad knows Xaden and the others have been supplying weapons to the gryphon fliers, there\u2019 s every chance this is an execution. \u201cIt\u2019s coming fr om the valley below .\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t see shit down there,\u201d Bodhi says, leaning over the edge of the masonry . \u201cWell, I can,\u201d Liam replies, \u201cand if those are what I think they are, we\u2019re fucked.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019 t tell me what you think they are\u2014tell me what you\u2019re sure of,\u201d Xaden orders. \u201cThe letter says this is a test of your command,\u201d the section leader reads behind us. \u201cYou have the choice of abandoning the village of our enemy or abandoning command of your wing.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d Bodhi reaches back and takes the letter . \u201cThey\u2019re testing our loyalty without actually saying it.\u201d Xaden folds hisarms over his chest, standing at my side. \u201cAccording to the missive, if we leave now, we\u2019ll make it to the new location of headquarters for Fourth Wing at Eltuval in time to carry out our orders for War Games, but if we leave, the trading post of Resson and its occupants will be destroyed.\u201d \u201cBy what?\u201d Imogen asks. \u201cVenin,\u201d Liam responds.",
  "My stomach drops. \u201cYou\u2019re positive?\u201d Xaden asks. Liam nods. \u201cAs sure as I can be without having actually seen them before. Four of them. Purple robes. Distended red veins spidering all around bright red eyes.",
  "Creepy as shit.\u201d \u201cSounds about right.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s weight shifts. \u201cI liked it better when we just delivered the weapons,\u201d Bodhi mutters. \u201cOh, and one guy with a giant-ass staff,\u201d Liam continues. \u201cAnd I swear to Dunne, one second the plain was clear and the next they were just\u2026there, walking toward the gates.\u201d His eyes are wide, his pupils blown as he uses his signet to see to the bottom of the valley . \u201cRed veins?\u201d Imogen asks. \u201cBecause magic corrupts their blood as they lose their souls,\u201d I murmur , looking up at Xaden, wondering if he remembers what Andarna said the night we took the tunnel to the flight field. \u201cNature likes everything in balance.\u201d Every head but Liam\u2019 s swings my way . \u201cIf the fables are true, at least.\u201d A part of me hopes they are, or I know next to nothing about the enemy below . Of course, if they\u2019re true\u2026 \u201cSeven gryphons have landed next to us,\u201d Tairn tells me. Everyone else stiffens, no doubt receiving the same message from their dragons. \u201cAndarna, stay with Tairn,\u201d I say. Xaden might trust the fliers, but Andarna is damn near defenseless.\u201cAll right,\u201d she answers. \u201cThe guy with the staf f just\u2014\u201d Liam starts.",
  "An explosion sounds, echoing up the sparsely treed valley , followed by a plume of blue smoke. My heart jolts at the sight. \u201cThose were the gates,\u201d he finishes. \u201cHow many people live in Resson?\u201d Bodhi asks. \u201cMore than three hundred,\u201d Imogen answers as another boom cracks through the valley . \u201cThat\u2019 s the post they do the yearly trades at.\u201d \u201cThen let\u2019s get down there.\u201d Bodhi turns and Xaden steps back, blocking his path with an outstretched hand. \u201cY ou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d \u201cWe have no idea what we\u2019re walking into.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s tone reminds me of that first day after Parapet. He\u2019 s in full command mode. \u201cSo we should just stand here while civilians die?\u201d Bodhi questions, and I tense. W e all do, watching Xaden. \u201cThat\u2019 s not what I\u2019m saying.\u201d Xaden shakes his head.",
  "He has to choose. That\u2019 s what the War Games missive said. He can abandon that village or his command, who\u2019 s now waiting for him at Eltuval. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fucking training exercise , Bodhi. Some\u2014if not all\u2014of us are going to die if we go down there. If we\u2019d been assig ned to an active wing, there would be far older , more experienced leadersh ip making this decision, but there aren\u2019 t. If we weren\u2019 t marked with rebellion relics, if we hadn\u2019 t been aiding the enemy\u201d\u2014his gaze darts to mine briefly\u2014\u201cwe wouldn\u2019 t even be here with this choice. So, all command structure aside, what are your thoughts?\u201d \u201cWe have the numbers,\u201d Soleil says, narrowing her brown eyes on the field and tapping her bright green fingernails rhythmically on the stone crenelations of the battlement. \u201cAnd air superiority .\u201d \u201cAt least there aren\u2019 t any wyvern.\u201d I scan the skies just to be sure. \u201cUh. What?\u201d Bodhi\u2019 s eyebrows rise. \u201cWyvern. Fables say venin created them to compete with dragons and, instead of channeling from them, channel power into them.\u201d Let\u2019s hopethere\u2019 s something in that book that isn\u2019 t true.",
  "\u201cYeah, let\u2019s not borrow trouble .\u201d Xaden shoots a look sideways at me, then studies the sky . \u201cThere are four venin and ten of us,\u201d Garrick says, walking away from the edge of the battlement. \u201cWe have the weapons to kill them,\u201d Liam says, turning his back on the valley . \u201cAnd Deigh told me seven gryphon fliers\u2014\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d the older brunett e from the lake says, striding down the battlement from the southeast corner of the outpost. \u201cI left the rest of the drift outside once we noticed that your outpost seems to be\u2026a bandoned.\u201d She glances over the rampart at the clouds of smoke rising from the valley beneath with a look of resignation, her shoulders dipping. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask you to fight with us.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d Garrick\u2019 s eyebrows rise. \u201cNo.\u201d She gives him a sad smile. \u201cFour of them is tantamount to a death sentence. The rest of my drift are making peace with our gods .\u201d She turns toward Xaden. \u201cI came to tell you to leave.",
  "You have no clue what they\u2019re capable of wielding. It only took two of them to bring down an entire city last month. Two. Of. Them. We lost two drifts trying to stop them. If there\u2019re four down there\u2026\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cThey\u2019re after something, and they\u2019re going to kill every single person in Resson to get it. Take your riot and go home while you can.\u201d Fear squeezes my chest, but my heart aches at the thought of leaving them to die. It goes against everything we stand for, even if they aren\u2019 t Navarrian civilians. \u201cWe have dragons,\u201d Imogen says, her pitch rising. \u201cSurely that has to count for something. W e\u2019re not afraid to fight.\u201d \u201cAre you afraid to die? Have any of you seen combat?\u201d The brunette\u2019 s gaze sweeps over us, and sudd enly I feel\u2026young as we reply with our silence. \u201cThoug ht not. Your dragons do count for something. They can flyyou far and fast. Dragon fire won\u2019 t kill them. Only the daggers you\u2019ve been bringing, and we have those.\u201d She looks at Xaden.",
  "\u201cTha nk you for everything you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve kept us alive these last couple of years and given us a fighting chance.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going down there to die,\u201d Xaden says matter -of-factly . \u201cYes.\u201d She nods as another explosion sounds. \u201cGet your riot out of here. Fast.\u201d Pivoting on her heel, she strides back down the rampa rt, her head held high before she disappears into the tower on the opposite end. Xaden\u2019 s jaw clenches, and I can see the battle raging in his eyes. An unbearable heaviness settles in my stomach.",
  "If we leave, they\u2019ll all die. Every civilian. Every flier. We won\u2019 t have killed them, but we\u2019ll be complicit in their deaths all the same. If we fight, we\u2019ll likely die with them. We can live as cowards or die as riders. Xaden\u2019 s shoulders straighten, and the rock in my stomach turns to nausea. He\u2019s made a decision. I can see it in the lines of his face, the resolve in his posture. \u201cSgaeyl says she has never run from a fight, and today will not be the first. And I\u2019m not going to stand by while innocent people are dying, either .\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to order any of you to join me. I\u2019m responsible for all of you. None of you crossed that parapet because you wanted to. None of you. You crossed it because I made a deal. I\u2019m the one who forced you into the quadrant, so I won\u2019 t think less of anyone who wants to fly for Eltuval instead.",
  "Make your choice.\u201d He tears his hand through his hair . \u201cI don\u2019 t want you in harm\u2019 s way .\u201d In a perfect world, that would be all I need to hear. \u201cIf the others get to make a choice, then so do I.\u201d His jaw flexes. \u201cWe\u2019re riders,\u201d Imogen says as another explosion sounds. \u201cWe defend the defenseless. That\u2019 s what we do.\u201d \u201cYou saved every single one of us here, cousin,\u201d Bodhi says. \u201cAnd we\u2019rethankful. Now , I\u2019d like to do what we\u2019ve trained for, and if it means I don\u2019t go home, then I guess my soul will be commended to Malek. I wouldn\u2019 t mind seeing my mother anyway .\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the same thing I did after Threshing our first year when we decided to start smuggling weap onry out,\u201d Garrick says. \u201cYou kept us alive all these years; we get to decide how we die. I\u2019m with you.\u201d \u201cExactly!\u201d Soleil says, drumming her fingertips just above the dagger sheathed at her thigh. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d Liam steps forward so he stands at my side. \u201cWe watched as our parents were executed because they had the courage to do the right thing. I\u2019d like to think my death would be just as honorable.\u201d My chest tightens.",
  "Their parents died to expose the truth while mine sacrificed my brother to keep this heinous secret. \u201cAgreed.\u201d Imogen nods. They all do. One by one, everyone agrees, until there\u2019 s only me. Xaden captures my gaze. If you think you\u2019ll ever convince a Sorrengail to risk their neck for anyone outside their own borders, then you\u2019r e a fool. Isn\u2019t that what the flier said at the lake? Fuck that. \u201cTairn?\u201d It\u2019s not just me going to war . \u201cWe will feast on their bones, Silver One.\u201d Graphic, but point made. I will not leave innocent people to die, no matter what side of the border they live on. I will not let my squadmates risk their lives while I run, despite the plea I see in Xaden\u2019 s eyes. At least Rhiannon, Sawyer , and Ridoc aren\u2019 t here. They\u2019ll live to be second-years.",
  "Mira will understand. I have no doubt that she would do the same.And as for Mom\u2026 The dagger on her desk means she knows and has done nothing to stop it. Guess I\u2019ll be the second child she sacrif ices to keep the existence of venin a secret. \u201cI\u2019ve been defenseless,\u201d I tell Xaden, lifting my chin. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m a rider. Riders fight.\u201d The others shout in agreement. A thousand emotions cross his face, but Xaden only nods as he walks toward the battlements. \u201cLiam. Give me a report.\u201d His foste r brothe r moves to his side and focuses. \u201cThe fliers are engaged, all seven \u2014six of them. Looks like they\u2019re trying to draw fire away from the civilians, but damn, the venin are wielding a kind of fire I\u2019ve never seen among riders. Three surround the city, and one is making his way toward a structure in the middle.",
  "A clock tower .\u201d Xaden nods, then divides us according to objectives. Garrick and Soleil will do a perime ter sweep for reconnaissance while the rest of us target the venin on various sides of Ress on, keeping an eye on the advance on the clock tower as we near it on each pass through town. \u201cThe only way to take them out is by dagger .\u201d \u201cThat means we\u2019ll have to dismount and fight once we get the townspeople to whatever safety we can find,\u201d Garrick adds, his face set in grim lines. \u201cDon\u2019 t throw your only weapons unless you\u2019re certain of your aim.\u201d Xaden nods. \u201cSave as many people as you can. Let\u2019 s go.\u201d We make our way down the steps and through the silent courtya rd, Xaden leading the way. When we emer ge from the outpost, our dragons wait, all perched on the edge of the ridgeline, shifting their weight in agitation as they survey the trading post below . I walk directly between T airn and Sgaeyl. \u201cI knew you\u2019d make the right choice,\u201d Sgaeyl says, glancing toward where Xaden approaches with Liam, their footsteps dangerou sly close tothe cliffside at my left. \u201cHe did, too.",
  "Even if he doesn\u2019 t like you putting yourself in danger , he knew you would.\u201d \u201cWell, he knows me a great deal better than I know him.\u201d I lift a brow at her. She blinks. \u201cYou\u2019re a far cry from the trembling girl who stood in the courtyar d and tried to mask her fear after Parapet. I appr ove.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking for your approval.\u201d If I\u2019m going to die, I might as well be honest in my last moments. She chuffs and nudges Tairn\u2019s head with hers, but he\u2019s solely focused on the trading post. The rocky terrain crunches under my boots as I walk beneath Tairn to where Andarna stands between his forelegs, watching the attack unfold beneath us. I put myself right in front of her, blocking her view of what has to be carnage. \u201c Stay her e and hide .\u201d I\u2019m not taking a kid into battle, period. \u201c\u2018Stay her e,\u2019\u201d she grumbles sarcastically in response. I bite back a sad smile. It\u2019s really too bad I won\u2019 t get to see her go through her rebellious adolescent years. \u201cAgr eed.\u201d Tairn dips a shoulder for me. \u201cYou\u2019re a tar get, little one.\u201d \u201cI mean it,\u201d I order Andarna, stroking my hand over her scaly nose.",
  "\u201cIf we\u2019re not back by morning, or if you think venin are approach ing, you fly home to the V ale. Get behind the war ds no matter what. \u201d Her nostrils flare. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d My chest hurts so badly , I fight the urge to rub the area above my heart, but I square my shoulders instea d. It has to be said. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel the moment when you\u2019ll know that there\u2019 s nothing to leave. And it might break your heart, but when you feel it, you fly . Promise me you\u2019ll fly .\u201d Heartbeats pass before Andarna finally nods. \u201cGo,\u201d I whisper , stroking her beautiful jaw one last time. She\u2019ll be fine. She\u2019ll make it back to the V ale. I can\u2019 t let myself believe any dif ferently .",
  "She turns aroun d and heads for the outpost, and I pull my shit togetherand walk betwee n Tairn\u2019s forelegs, taking one last, quick look at the valley . Xaden and Liam stand to my right, doing the same. A screech rends the air, and an enormous gray dragon emer ges from a valley two ridgelines to the south\u2026across the Poromish border . It tucks its two legs up under its massive body as it flies away from us, heading straight for Resson. \u201cDo we have a riot nearby?\u201d Liam asks. \u201cNo,\u201d Xaden answers. It\u2019s as though the ground beneath my feet shifts. I could have sworn I saw a riot of dragons across the border. Isn\u2019t that what Mira said at Montserrat? The dragon shrieks again, spewing a streak of blue fire down the mountainside, setting some of the smaller trees on fire before it reaches the plains where Resson stands. Blue. Fire. No. No. No. \u201cWyvern.\u201d My heart launches into my throat. \u201cXaden, it has two legs, not four. It\u2019s not a dragon. It\u2019s a wyvern.\u201d Maybe if I say it a few more times, I\u2019ll believe what I\u2019m seeing. Holy . Shit.",
  "Is this what leadership has been redacting ? They\u2019re supposed to be myth, not flesh-and-blood beings.",
  "But then again, so are venin. \u201cWell, there went our air superiority ,\u201d Imogen says across from us, then shrugs. \u201cFuck \u2019em. They can die, too.\u201d \u201cThey have created abominations,\u201d Tairn says, a low growl rumbling in his chest. \u201cDid you know?\u201d \u201cI suspected. Why do you think I\u2019ve been so hard on you during flight maneuvers?\u201d \u201cYou and I ar e going to have to work on our communication skills.\u201d \u201cGuess we know all the details now ,\u201d Liam says. \u201cAnyone want to change their minds?\u201d Xaden asks down the line. Noneof us answer . \u201cNo? Then mount up.\u201d I walk toward T airn\u2019s shoulder as Xaden strides over to me. \u201cTurn around, Violence,\u201d he orders, and I pivot, looking up at him. He unsheathes one of his daggers and slides it in the empty spot I have at my ribs. \u201cNow you have two.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going to lecture me about staying safe in the outpost?\u201d I ask, my emotions rioting at his nearness. He hid all of this from me, and yet my chest aches just looking at him. \u201cIf I asked you to stay behind, would you?\u201d His eyes bore into mine. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cExactly .",
  "I try not to pick fights I know I can\u2019 t win.\u201d My eyes flare. \u201cSpeaking of knowing you\u2019ll win fights, General Melgren will know what\u2019 s happened here. He\u2019ll be able to see the outcome of the battle even now .\u201d He shakes his head slowly and points to his neck, to the rebellion relic snaking around his throat. \u201cDo you remember how I told you I realized it was a gift, not a curse?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Back when I was in his bed. \u201cJust trust me\u2014because of this, Melgren can\u2019 t see a fucking thing.\u201d My lips part, remembering Melgren saying he liked to lay eyes on Xaden once a year . \u201cAny other secrets you\u2019re keeping from me?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d He cups my neck and leans into my space. \u201cStay alive, and I promise I\u2019ll tell you whatever you want to know .\u201d The simple confession makes my heart clench. As angry as I am, I can\u2019t imagine a world without him in it. \u201cI need you to survive this, even if I hate that I still love you.\u201d \u201cI can live with that.\u201d A corner of his mouth lifts as he drops his hand and turns away from me, heading toward Sgaeyl. Tairn dips his shoulder again and I mount, settling into the saddle andstrapping my thighs in after I secure my pack behind the seat.",
  "It\u2019s time. \u201cFind a good hiding place, Andarna. I can\u2019t stand the thought of you being hurt.\u201d \u201cGo for the thr oat,\u201d she says, walking into the abandoned outpost. Sgaeyl launches to my right, and I hold the pommels tight when Tairn springs skyward with great, heavy beats of his wings. \u201cTher e\u2019s something in that trading post.",
  "We all feel it,\u201d Tairn says as he banks with Sgaeyl, plummeting from the ridgeline into a steep dive that leaves my stomach behind. The saddle straps dig into my thighs, but they do their job and keep me seated as I lower my riding goggles to shield my eyes from the wind. We fly into the shade, the sun sinking behind the Cliffs of Dralor and throwing the afternoon into shadow . Another explosi on hits , this time taking out a chunk of the post \u2019 s high stone walls as Tairn pulls up , narrowly missing a gryphon rider and bringing us level across the post , flying too fast to hear anything more than the screams of townspeople as they run through the streets , fleeing for the exodus at the post gates . \u201cWher e did the wyvern go?\u201d I ask T airn. \u201cRetr eated into the valley . Don\u2019 t worry\u2014it will come back.\u201d Oh. Joy .",
  "My gaze sweeps the rooftops of the little post until I see it\u2014him\u2014 whatever . There\u2019 s a figure standing at the top of a wooden clock tower , wearing purple floor -length robes that billow in the wind while he hurls blue flames like daggers at the civilians below . He\u2019s more terrifying than any illustrator could have depicted, rivers of red veins fanning in every direction around soulless eyes consumed by magic. His face is gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and thin lips, a gnarled hand gripping a long red cane made of some misshapen wood. \u201cTairn!\u201d \u201cYes, let\u2019s.\u201d Tairn banks away from Sgaeyl, pulling us in a hard turn andtaking us into the village. A few beats of his wings later, fire streams from his mouth, and he incinerates the clock tower on a flyby . \u201cGot him!\u201d I turn in the saddle, watching as the wooden structure collapses in the blast. It\u2019s only a matter of seconds before the venin walks out of the flame s, though, and there isn\u2019t a scratch on him. \u201cOh, fuck. He\u2019s still there,\u201d I call out as we cut back across the post to get to our assigned area, mentally kicking myself for thinking it could have been that simple.",
  "There\u2019 s a reason these creatu res are what make up most Navarrians\u2019 nightmare stories\u2014and it isn\u2019t because they\u2019re easy to kill. We have to get close enough to get a dagger in him. I turn forward just in time to see a giant mass of wings and teeth cut across our path with an earspli tting screech, and Tairn\u2019s tail smashes into the stone walls behind me, knocking the masonry loose as he dodges the wyvern. We just barely evade the hissing curl of blue fire that streams from its mouth, catching a nearby tree on fire. \u201cThe wyvern is back!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s a differ ent one,\u201d Tairn barks. \u201cI\u2019m r elaying or ders to the others.\u201d Of course he is. Xaden might command the riders on this field, but Tairn is clearly leading the dragons. The wyvern swings around and heads toward the town\u2019 s cente r, tucking up two legs and beating spiderwebbed wings. It bears a female rider in maroon flight gear that resembles our own, and her eyes are the same eerie red color as the venin on the clock tower .",
  "\u201cXaden, ther e\u2019s mor e than one wyvern.\u201d There\u2019 s a moment of silence, but I can feel Xaden\u2019 s palpable shock, then rage. \u201cIf you get separated fr om T airn, call out, then fight until I get ther e.\u201d \u201cNo chance of that happening. I\u2019m not letting her off my back, wingleader ,\u201d Tairn growls as I get my first good look at the airspace above the city, flooded with dragons, gryphons, and wyvern, just like in the creation fable.\u201cSoleil found a sealed entrance to what looks to be a mine,\u201d Xaden says. \u201cI need\u2014\u201d Tairn turns abruptly , veering toward the mountains. \u201c\u2014you to see if you can put down some cover so Garrick and Bodhi can get the townspeople evacuated,\u201d he finishes. \u201cLiam is on his way .\u201d \u201cOn it.\u201d My pulse leaps. \u201cTairn, I can\u2019 t aim.\u201d \u201cYou will,\u201d he says like it\u2019s a foregone conclusion. \u201cOrders are being dispersed amid the gryphons.\u201d \u201cDragons can speak to gryphons?\u201d My eyebrows shoot up. \u201cNaturally .",
  "How do you think we communicated befor e humans got involved?\u201d I hunker down across his neck as we dart above the city, passi ng over a clinic, what looks to be a school, and rows and rows of an open-air market that\u2019s currently on fire. There\u2019 s no sign of the purple-robed venin we first saw as we sail over the shrivele d body of a gryphon and its rider near the center of town. My stomach turns, especially when I see a wyvern circling back toward them\u2014and Sgaeyl is on an intercept course. \u201cShe can hold her own,\u201d Tairn reminds me. \u201cAnd so can he. We have orders. Focus.\u201d Focus. Right. We pass families scurrying from their ruined homes, then over the city walls, heading toward the opening in the side of the moun tain where Soleil\u2019 s Brown Clubtail swings its tail into the wood planks covering the abandoned tunnel. There are a few outbuildings lining the road but not much else.",
  "Tairn pulls hard to the left as we approach, the strap digging into my legs as my weight shifts in the saddl e with the abrupt motion. Then he flares his wings to hover in front of Soleil, facing Resson and the scream ing crowd that runs the hundred yards between the city walls and us, led by a pair of gryphons and their fliers who continuously look behind them, scanning theskies. But what they don\u2019t see is the venin striding our way from north of the gate, watching the crowd\u2019 s movement with a narrowed red gaze. The veins on both sides of her eyes are more pronounced than the earlier rider \u2019s, and her long blue robe reminds me of the staff bearer who survive d the clock- tower blast. \u201cI\u2019ve already told Fuil. She\u2019ll protect Soleil,\u201d Tairn says, angling toward the threat. \u201cGet us away fr om the cr owd.\u201d Power already sizzles beneath my skin. A child stumbles on the dirt road, and my heart lurches as her father scoops her into his arms and continues to sprint. Deigh passes, and I see him land out of the corner of my eye as I lift my arms and let my power rip free, focusing on the venin. Lightning cracks. A section of the city wall crumbles.",
  "Fuck. \u201cKeep going. Deigh says they need mor e time!\u201d Tairn ur ges. I make the mistake of turning in the saddle, noting that both Liam and Soleil are unseated, ushering the townspeople into the mine, while Deigh and Fuil guard separate sides of the evacuation path. If anything happens\u2014 if one of those wyvern circling the town decides to take notice\u2014they\u2019re vulnerable. But so are the people they\u2019re protecting. A trio of gryph ons flies in, all three dangling townspeople from their talons, dropping them off at the entrance to the mine and looping back for another run. Energy rips through me as I aim a bolt for the venin, this one shattering an outbuilding along the hillside to our right. Boards split and wood flies as it collapses.",
  "The venin\u2019s attention whips upward, and my stomach twists when she spots me. There\u2019 s pure malice in her red eyes as she reaches forward with her left hand, then flips it, fisting air .Rocks tumble down the mountainside. Soleil throws up her hands, stopping the slide before it can crush the people running into the mine below. Her arms shake, but the boulders fall on either side of the evacuation path, leaving the escape clear . I whip back toward the venin and gasp. Raw power is palpable in the air, lifting the hairs on my arms as the venin stands with her palms lowered to the ground. The grass around her turns brown, then the flowers of the wild clover bushes wilt and the leaves curl, losing all their color . \u201cTairn, is she\u2026\u201d \u201cChanneling,\u201d he growls. I fling another flare of energy as the blight spreads outward from the venin, as though she\u2019s draining the very essence of the land, but it hits too close to the road, and the straggler racing toward safety , for my comfort. \u201cWatch out. Deigh says that building on the other side of the road has a crate of something marked with Liam\u2019 s family crest,\u201d Tairn tells me as I fire off another blast that lands nowhere near the venin.",
  "\u201cHe says it\u2019s highly\u2026 unstable,\u201d he finishes, pausing as he relays the information. \u201cNot worried about the building ,\u201d I reply as the circle of death expands under Tairn\u2019s beating wings, and I draw more power from Tairn, poising to strike again. Soleil charges toward the venin with Fuil on her heels, her dagg er palmed and ready as the rest of the group of townspeople make it into the tunnel. This is all worth it as long as they survive.",
  "The wave of death pushes forw ard from the venin, flowing outward and catching up with the fleeing civilian in the middle of the road. He falls, then screams soundlessly , curling in on himself as his body becomes nothing but a husk of a shell. Air freezes in my lungs and my heart stutters. The venin just\u2026 \u201cSoleil!\u201d I yell, but it\u2019s already too late. The third-year stumbles a fewsteps into the dead zone, her dragon reaching for her as they both buckle and fall, Fuil throwing up a cloud of dirt with her heavy impact. They desiccate in a matter of seconds, their bodies shrivelin g. A vise clamps around my chest, and for a second, I can\u2019t breathe. The venin has even more power now . \u201cTell Deigh!\u201d I look back over my shoulder to see Liam sprinting for Deigh. He needs time.",
  "\u201cAlready done.\u201d Tairn rolls left as a fireball churns up at us, the first of a volley that causes us to retreat across the road. \u201cWe lost Soleil,\u201d I tell Xaden. The only acknowledgment is a wave of sorrow , and I know it\u2019 s his. The gryphons take flight, their riders wielding what looks to be lesser magic at the venin as two wyvern approach, both riderless. \u201cTell them to change tactics. They don\u2019t stand a chance if they can\u2019t get close to that venin,\u201d I tell T airn. The gryphons change course, and I loose my power again, hitting closer to the venin. She glares up at me, then turns at the sound of flapping wings. Garrick and the other marked third-years are coming. She\u2019s outnumbered, and damn, I hope she knows it. The gryphons team up, tearing into one of the approaching wyvern as Liam mounts and Deigh launches, escaping the spreading ring of death, but the other wyvern dips low , heading for the venin. Right on course to pass by the outbuilding. \u201cYou said that building has unstable material in it, right?\u201d I ask.",
  "\u201cYes.\u201d I can\u2019 t be sure I\u2019ll hit it, but\u2014 \u201cExcellent idea.\u201d Tairn puts us into position, hovering about twenty feet aboveground as Liam flies for the gryphons abov e us, wielding spears of ice into the injured wyvern\u2019 s throat. Blood streams as the wyvern falls from the sky with anear-piercing cry . One down. The venin reaches the road, and the wyvern skids to a landing on the dirt path so she can mount. \u201cNow!\u201d I shout. Tairn breathes in deep and exhales pure fire as the wyvern takes off, sending the outbuilding up in a blaze that ignites whatever is within. Heat rushes my face, singeing my cheek as the building explodes, engulfing everything around it. The firestorm nearly catches us, but Tairn banks left, narrowl y missing the blast. I shout, throwing up my fist as we circle back, the wind easing the sting in my cheek.",
  "We have one wyvern down, a good share of the townspeople evacuated, and there\u2019 s no way anything survived that blast. Tairn dips his right wing low and we turn sharply , getting set up to make another run through town. I glance to the right and gasp. Not only did that blast not kill the wyvern, but its rider is alive and well, too, flying toward\u2014 Shit. Shit. Shit. There are more wyvern than dragons exiting the valley to the south, and I\u2019m tryin g hard not to panic when blazing-hot blue fire streams past us. I pivot in the saddle and see a wyvern on our tail, approaching frighteningly fast as we circle the post walls. \u201cAny idea how to kill that many wyvern?\u201d I ask Tairn, panic sitting on my chest like an anchor that threatens to pull me under into the chaos of my thoughts. There are at least six wyvern, from what I can see, all with terrifying wingspans and sharp teeth, and they\u2019re heading straight for us.",
  "\u201c The same methods that can kill us , \u201d Tairn says , leading the wyvern away from the post \u2019 s center , where Garrick and Bodhi are both on foot , chasing down the venin from the clock tower , daggers in hand. \u201c I don \u2019 t exactly have a cr oss-bolt handy ! \u201d \u201c No , but you do have lightning , and a bolt of that will stop any dragon \u2019 s heart. \u201d \u201c Tell me you warned the others how Soleil and Fuil died. \u201d Everyone touching the ground is vulnerable . \u201cThey all know what they risk.\u201d Gods, there are still kids down there, some screaming, others heartbreakingly silent as their mothers drag their dead bodies from the streets. There are no words.",
  "\u201cWe need to draw them away from the city,\u201d I tell Xaden, turning back in the saddle as far as the bands across my thighs will let me to get a better vantage point of the airspace and the wyvern, some of which seemed to have slowed in order to circle the remains of the clock tower . \u201cWhatever they want must be ther e,\u201d Tairn says.",
  "\u201cAgr eed on both counts. Do what you can to give the rest time to evacuate,\u201d Xaden responds. \u201cWe\u2019re clearing the edge of town now.\u201d He pauses, and a ripple of worry pushes through our emotional barrier . \u201cTry not to die.\u201d \u201cWorking on it.\u201d A wyvern dives only to climb again with a human leg hang ing from between its teeth. We circle back, then head south through the trading post, away from the city\u2019s center and whatever Bodhi and Garrick are doing. \u201cThey\u2019r e not following,\u201d Tairn grunts. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to draw them out.\u201d \u201cThat venin didn\u2019 t seem to like when I wielded lightning.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a thr eat.\u201d \u201cSo let\u2019 s get their attention and thr eaten.\u201d He growls in approval. I open the floodgates of Tairn\u2019s power , letting it roil and billow beneathmy skin. As soon as we\u2019re outside the walls, I throw my hands up and let it burst free. Lightning streak s the sky, earni ng us the notice of the horde of wyvern, one of which peels off its flight pattern and soars in our direction, its poison-barbed tails flicking behind it.",
  "Maybe this wasn\u2019 t the best idea. \u201cWe\u2019re committed now ,\u201d Tairn reminds me. Right. They\u2019re finally outside the city walls. I summo n more power and wield, my arms trembling with the effort to control the deluge of raw energy. Lightning strikes once, missing the wyvern by more than I\u2019d like to admit. Dread fills my mouth with the taste of ash. I\u2019m not ready for this. \u201cTry again.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019 t have enough contr ol\u2014\u201d \u201cTry again!\u201d Tairn demands. I wield again, ripping down the walls between Tairn and me, and more of the energy he channels rips through me. Lightning splits the dusk-hued sky in a blast so bright, I blink. \u201cAgain!\u201d I let the power overcome me again and again, concentrating on the location of the wyvern as Tairn dodges blasts of blue fire. Finally, a strike hits the one behind us, dropping him from the sky. It hits the hillside with a satisfying crash. \u201cWhat about the venin it\u2019s bonded to?\u201d I tremble with the effort of controlling the power , fighting to keep it from overtaking me. Sweat drips down my face. \u201cHopefully they\u2019r e like us.",
  "Kill the wyvern and the rider dies, but it\u2019 s har d to tell with so many riderless ones.\u201d\u201c\u2018Hopefully\u2019 isn\u2019t the best word right now\u2026\u201d I turn in the saddle and watch in horror as two more riderless wyvern fly out of the valley .",
  "\u201cThe civilians need mor e time to r each the mine. Let\u2019 s give it to them.\u201d Tairn growls in agreement, and we speed back over the post. Xaden has one wyvern by the throat, strangling it with shadows as a third-year hurls ice at its rider, and the other four are doing everything they can to drive the newcomers back with a combination of dragon fire and magic. Power jolts through me in wave after burning wave as I wield more lightning than I ever have in practice. I swing my arm around and aim another bolt at a wyvern flying near the front gate\u2014or what used to be the front gate. I miss the wyvern but hit an empty tower , sending stone flying in all directions, a large chunk hitting a wyvern in the tail and causing it to spin in midair . Tairn banks another hard turn and we come back around. I take a deep breath, then call a lightning bolt\u2014this one striking a wyvern directly in its upper back with a satisfying sizzle. The giant beast shrieks, then smashes into a nearby hillside with a thunderous boom. Coming back around again for another pass, and heady from my recent kill, I throw out three more bolts of lightning in quick succession.",
  "Unfortunately , more speed doesn\u2019 t translate to more accuracy , and the adrenaline rush isn\u2019t helping my aim, either . I manage to cause three more alarming explos ions, though\u2014o ne of which distracts a rather large wyvern that had been on Bodhi\u2019 s tail, giving him a moment\u2019 s advantage, which his dragon seizes by banking hard left and coming up behind the wyvern and sinking its teeth into its leathery gray neck. There\u2019 s an ominous crack, and then Bodhi\u2019s dragon releases the wyvern\u2019 s lifeless body , letting it fall to the ground fifty feet below . \u201cOn the left!\u201d I shout as two more wyvern come into view on our rear flank.I leave the evasive maneuvers up to Tairn and concentrate on bringing down as many strikes as possible as the wyvern gain speed on us. My arms tremble, growin g weaker and weaker with each bolt I try to control to keep from hitting our own riders.",
  "Sgaeyl is on the west side of the outpost, and my heart crawl s into my throat when she flies low and Xaden does an impressive runni ng jump off her back, landing with a roll onto the street below . Almost immediately , shadows pull in every direction and cover the people screaming as they try to run for cover from the snarling jaws of a hungry wyvern. One of the wyvern on my tail must notice Xaden out of the saddle, because it tucks its wings for a moment, diving for the ground, only to widen them and pull out at the last minute, gliding mere feet above the silky shadows.",
  "Shit. It\u2019s heading straight for Xaden, its jaws openi ng wide as though it plans to just snatch Xaden up like a quick bite to eat. \u201cXaden!\u201d I scream out loud, but he\u2019s already noticed the wyvern, throwing a rope of shadows high above the buildings in a perfect lasso around Sgaeyl\u2019 s head, and she yanks him up off the ground and out of the path of the oncoming wyvern. One minute Xaden is dangling from the shadow rope and the next he\u2019s back in his saddle as Sgaey l banks for another low pass through town. But I was so focused on Xaden, I completely forgot about the wyvern on my own tail. Tairn hasn\u2019 t, though, and starts to climb higher and higher , leading the wyvern from the post as he gains altitude nauseatingly fast. \u201cViolence!\u201d Xaden screams. \u201cBeneath you! \u201d I look down and gasp. A stream of blue fire billows up toward us. \u201cBank!\u201d Tairn rolls left, and my ass leave s the saddle, held in only by the straps as he rolls us upside down to narrowly avoid the blast. But when he straightens, the wyvern is still on us.",
  "My heart lurches into my throat as its mouth gapes open, its sharp, bloodied teeth snapping as it lunges for Tairn\u2019sside. \u201cNo!\u201d I lift my arms to throw a bolt in its direction and prepare for impact. A blur of blue shoots between us, and the wyvern is knocked away by the body of a navy dragon\u2014Sgaeyl. Her jaws tear through the side of the wyvern in several rapid, brutal bites, flesh ripping and blood spraying in the most vicious midair meal I have ever seen. Then she flips and catches the devoured wyvern by the head with her daggertail, sending its dead body sailing several hundred feet before crashing to the ground. Sgaeyl picks up speed, banks, and flies right by us, her wing gliding under Tairn\u2019s almost affectionately\u2014which is in complete contrast to the menacing glare that seems direc ted at me, wyvern blood still dripping from her jaws.",
  "Message received. It\u2019s her job to keep an eye on Xaden\u2019 s back, and mine is to watch T airn\u2019s. I do a quick turn in my saddle , checking all our sides for more wyvern , then tell Tairn , \u201c Let \u2019 s climb so we can get a better count of what we \u2019 re facing. \u201d We \u2019 ve barely made it a hundred feet above the town when I spy Liam and Deigh flying hard and fast in the opposite direction , with a venin riding a wyvern on his tail .",
  "\u201cLiam needs help! \u201d I rush to explain. \u201cOn it,\u201d Tairn says, flipping us in midair . We hang in the sky for a second before his massive wings catch the air and turn us so that we\u2019re heading straight for Liam. The venin raises a staff of some sort, sending balls of blue flame at Deigh, but he manages to avoid them all as Liam stands up and runs along Deigh\u2019 s spine toward his dagge rtail. At the last second, Deigh uses his tail to whip Liam up into the air toward the wyvern. I don\u2019t even have time to scream before he lands in a crouch on the wyvern\u2019 s rear and pulls out one of the runed daggers like the two Xaden gave me.The venin whip s around, raising his staff, but Liam is brutally fast and slits the venin\u2019 s throat with sickening precision. The wyvern stops beating its wings within seconds, its heavy body free-falling to the ground, and Liam leaps from his back just as Deigh flies beneath, easily catching him. A wyve rn flies at us from the left, approaching with great beats of its wings.",
  "\u201cTairn!\u201d Power fills my veins and I lift my hands, but Tairn rolls, flipping my world upside down as he rakes his claws and morningstartail along the wyvern, from throat to tail, splitting it open in midair , then leveling out as the wyvern streaks a bloody path to the ground. The rush in my head is a result of more than T airn\u2019s acrobatics.",
  "For the first time since we agreed to try to defend the civilians in this trading post, since we were told there were four venin and no way we could win, a little bit of the panic sitting on my chest starts to ease. We might actually be able to survive today . Maybe. Just then, another wyvern drops out of a cloud above us, diving at Tairn, gaining speed as it tucks in its wings, becoming a teeth-tipped spear . There\u2019 s no time for evasive maneuvers. It\u2019s seconds away\u2014but red fills my vision and Deigh is there, driving into the side of the massive gray beast. There\u2019 s no breath of relief as the collision sends Liam hurtling off Deigh\u2019 s back and across the base of T airn\u2019s neck at breakneck velocity . \u201cViolet!\u201d \u201cLiam!\u201d I catch his scrambling hands as he slides by and hold on, a cry escaping as my shoulders pop and subluxate from the strain of catching his weight, and T airn pitches in a sharp turn to follow Deigh. \u201cHold on!\u201d Grimacing, Liam crawls forwa rd on his elbows despite the impossible angle, then grasps the pommels of the saddle. I throw myself over him , sheltering",
  "his head and holding on with everything I have as Tairn rolls and banks to keep close but clear of Deigh and the massive gray wyvern.Locked in battle only a few feet away , their talons shred through the scales of the other amid snapping teeth\u2014and Deigh \u2019 s catastrophic roars of pain .",
  "They\u2019re too close for me to act, and there\u2019 s no guarantee I\u2019ll hit the wyvern and not Deigh with my lightning. There\u2019 s nothing I can do but secure Liam. Grabbing the lap belt I never use, I wind it around Liam\u2019 s torso and buckle it. \u201cThat should hold you until we can get you back to Deigh, but I can\u2019t wield without hitting him!\u201d I yell as wind whips around us. The agony in his eyes steals my breath. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d I cry, my fingers searching for purchase on his leathers to pull him closer . I settle for the back of his collar and yank. \u201cWhy would you risk it?\u201d Gods, if anything happens to them\u2026 His gaze collides with mine. \u201cThat thing was going to take a chunk out of Tairn.",
  "You\u2019ve saved my life and now it\u2019s my turn. No matter what you think of me for keeping secrets, we\u2019re friends, V iolet.\u201d Response is impossible as Tairn rolls again, lifting Liam\u2019 s entire body , and the leather belt slips to just under his arms. I fist my hands in the back of his flight leathers, but there\u2019 s not much to grab on to. Heartbeats pass and I can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t think past the desperation to keep Liam safe, until Tairn levels out again, trying to stay as close as he can to Deigh without risking any of us in the process. But then Deigh\u2019 s scream slices me to the bone as the two lock into a dive. \u201cCan\u2019 t you do something?\u201d I beg T airn. \u201cWorking on it!\u201d He pitches right and plumme ts, positioning himself around the downward-spiraling duel to strike. It should be us fighting for our lives, not Liam and Deigh. And gods, Deigh is losing, which means Liam\u2014 My throat constricts. No. Not going to happen. \u201cGet over here!\u201d I shout at Xade n. Energy crackles through my hands, but there\u2019 s no clear tar get. They\u2019re moving too fast.\u201cI\u2019m hunting the venin at the walls!\u201d he answers.",
  "\u201cDeigh is fighting for his life!\u201d The heartbeat of terror squeezing my chest like a vise isn\u2019t mine. It\u2019s Xaden\u2019 s. \u201cIf I leave, these civilians ar e all dead!\u201d We\u2019re on our own. A quick glance at the field tells me every other dragon is locked in its own battle. Tairn\u2019s tail swings out, slamm ing into the wyvern\u2019 s hindquarters, and comes away bloody , but the fucking thing doesn\u2019 t release Deigh. Its claws flex, burrowing deeper beneath the red\u2019 s scales. \u201cDeigh!\u201d Liam\u2019 s scream is raw , his voice breaking at the end. Tairn lunges, snapping at the wyvern\u2019 s shoulder and drawing blood, but it\u2019s not enough. He swings around to get a better angle on the wyvern, and the force nearly costs Liam his grip, but the buckle holds. Another riderless wyvern flies at us from the right. \u201cOn the right!\u201d Tairn whips his body faster than I\u2019ve ever felt and rips out the throat of the new threat, shaking the wyvern like a doll, then releases his jaws and lets the thing fall hundreds of feet to the mountainside below . Then Tairn dives to catch up with Deigh and the wyvern as they race toward the ground. Dread settles in my chest, ominous and heavy .",
  "\u201cWe\u2019re on our way!\u201d Xaden says. But he\u2019ll be too late. \u201cViolet!\u201d Liam shouts over the wind, and I rip my attention from the gruesome battle alongside us as we spiral downward. \u201cWe have to take out the riders.\u201d \u201cI know!\u201d I reply . \u201cWe will!\u201d He just needs to hang on. They both do. \u201cNo, I mean that\u2019 s the\u2014\u201d Tairn lunges again, and we\u2019re thrown sideways as he rips anoth er hole in the wyvern\u2019 s wings with his teeth, raking down its tail with his talons, but the creature has Deigh in a death lock. Its wings are shredded now, but itdoesn\u2019 t seem to care as its claws dig into Deigh\u2019 s underbelly , like it\u2019s willing to mindlessly die to make the kill.",
  "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d I promise Liam, wind stinging my cheeks. It has to be all right; even though the ground rushes at us, close r and closer each second, it just\u2026has to be. Deigh screams again, the sound weaker and higher -pitched than the last. It\u2019s a cry . \u201cWe have to pull up!\u201d Tairn warns. \u201cHe\u2019 s dying!\u201d Liam lunges across T airn\u2019s back, reaching for his dragon as if so he can touch the Red Daggertail one last time. \u201cJust hold\u2014\u201d I start, but Deigh\u2019s shriek of pain closes my throat, strangling the words. He\u2019 s being eviscerated, and there\u2019 s nothing we can do. The wyvern roars in victory a heartbeat before they crash into the hillside with a sickening thud. The wyvern limps away on its hind legs and the talons that tip its wings. Deigh doesn\u2019 t move. Liam\u2019 s raw scream shatters my heart, and Tairn flares his wings, banking hard to keep us from the same gruesome fate. \u201cDEIGH.\u201d Tairn\u2019s grief blasts through my body as he streams fire at the wyvern\u2019 s retreating back, and Andarna\u2019 s cry fills my head. No.",

No. No. No. That means\u2026 \u201cLiam!\u201d I grab for my friend as we land at speed, Tairn\u2019s claws digging into the ground to stop us close to Deigh\u2019 s body . \u201cYou only have minutes,\u201d Tairn warns. \u201cDeigh,\u201d Liam whispers, falling limp against T airn\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019ll get you to him,\u201d I promise, already fumbling with the strap \u2019s buckle.\u201cDeigh\u2019 s gone ,\u201d I cry to Xaden, my voice a trembling mess. \u201cLiam is dying.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I feel his terror , his sorrow , and his overpowering anger wrap around my mind, mixing with my own until it hurts to breathe.",
  "Minutes. W e have minutes. \u201cJust hold on,\u201d I whisper to Liam, fighting not to cry as he looks up at me with those sky-blue eyes, wide with shock and pain. After everything Liam has given up for me, this is the least I can do for him. I can get him to Deigh the same way I know he would carry me to Tairn or Andarna. Tairn lies down completel y, flattening his massive frame as much as possible as I unstrap my thighs. Then I wrap my arms around Liam\u2019 s bulky frame and we slide down Tairn\u2019s side, hitting our feet on the rocky hillside far from the trading post. Deigh lies a couple of dozen feet away , his body folded at an unnatural angle. This isn\u2019t fair. This isn\u2019t right. Not Deigh. Not\u2026Liam. They\u2019re the strongest of our year . They\u2019re the best of us. \u201cCan\u2019 t make it,\u201d Liam says, stumbling forward and tripping. I rush to catch him as he goes down, but his substantial weig ht is too much for me, and we both fall to our knees. \u201cWe can make it,\u201d I force out through my tightening throat, trying to hook his arm over my shoulders. We\u2019re so close.",
  "If a venin comes along, then I\u2019ll deal with it. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d He crumples agains t me, sliding down my side. I fall back on my heels and his head lands in my lap as his body goes limp. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Violet,\u201d he says, looking up at me, and I shove my goggles on top of my head so I can see him clearer . He\u2019s struggling to breathe. \u201cIt\u2019s not all right.\u201d I want to scream with the injustice of it, but that won\u2019 t help. My hand trembles as I slide his riding goggles up to his forehead, thenbrush his blond hair back off his forehead.",

Nothing anyone can do.",
  "How can all this power be so fucking useless ? The pulse under my thumb slows. \u201cGood. That\u2019 s good.\u201d He forces a weak smile, and that dimple makes a faint appearanc e before his expression falters. \u201cAnd I know you feel betrayed, but Xaden needs you. And I don\u2019t just mean alive, Violet. He needs you. Please hear him out.\u201d \u201cAll right.\u201d I nod, fighting to force a watery smile. He could ask for anything right now, and I\u2019d give it to him. \u201cThank you, Liam. Thank you for being my shadow . Thank you for being my friend.\u201d He blurs in my vision as the tears come faster . \u201cIt\u2019s been. My honor .\u201d Liam\u2019 s chest rattles as his lungs struggle. A gust of wind blows the loosened strands of my braid back from myface.",
  "Seconds later, I feel Xaden racing toward us, a torrent of his emotions overwhelming my own. \u201cNo, Liam,\u201d Xaden chokes out as he crouches in front of us, the muscles in his face working to control his expression, but there\u2019 s no hiding the despair that pushes at our mental connection. \u201cDeigh,\u201d Liam pleads in a strangled whisper , turning his head toward Xaden. \u201cI know , brother .\u201d Xaden\u2019 s jaw flexes and our gazes lock above Liam as tears overflow my eyes. \u201cI know .\u201d He leans forward and lifts Liam into his arms, then stands, carrying him. \u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d He walk s slowly across the gravelly terrain to Deigh\u2019 s body , saying things I can\u2019t hear from where I kneel, the rocks digging into my knees through the fabric of the leather as I watch Xaden say goodbye. Xaden lowers Liam, sitting him against Deigh\u2019 s unblemished shoulder , then kneels beside him, nodding slowly at whatever Liam has said. The cry of a wyvern splits the air above us, and I look up instinctively . A cloud of flapping gray wings moves toward us from higher up the valley . Wyvern. Dozens and dozens of wyvern. \u201cLook up at the valley!\u201d Liam\u2019 s head rolls slowly as they both look.",
  "Xaden\u2019 s head bows, and my breath freezes in my lungs as shadows momentarily whip out around him, like a blast of menace and sorrow . Seconds later, his soundless, soul-rending scream fills my head with such force that my heart shatters like glass against a stone floor . I don\u2019 t need to ask. Liam is gone. Liam, who never complained about being my shadow , never hesitated to help, never bragged about being the best of our year.",
  "He died protecting me. Oh gods, and I just asked him if we\u2019d ever really been friends an hour ago. Just one of those beasts manage d to kill my friend; what the hell can that many accomplish?A bloodied wyvern dives for us, and Tairn throws his wing over me. I hear the sound of his teeth snapping and a sharp cry above me before his wing retracts. \u201cWe\u2019re targets on the gr ound,\u201d Tairn says as the wyvern flies away . \u201cThen let\u2019s be the ones who hunt.\u201d I stumble to my feet in time to see Xaden running my way . \u201cViolence!\u201d Xaden grasps my shoulders, determination lining his features. \u201cLiam told me to tell you that there are two riders with that horde.\u201d \u201cWhy would he tell me and not\u2014\u201d An anvil sits on my chest. \u201cBecause he knew I\u2019d have to be the one who holds off the wyvern as long as possible.\u201d He studies my face like he\u2019ll never see it again. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the one who can kill them all.\u201d It will kill me to wield that many times, but I\u2019m the best shot we have. The best shot he has to survive. \u201cYou can kill them.\u201d He yanks me close and kisses my forehea d. \u201cThere is no me without you,\u201d he says against my skin.",
  "Before I can react, he turns toward the valley and lifts his arms\u2014 throwing up a wall of shado w that consumes the space between the ridgelines.",
  "\u201cGo! I\u2019ll give you as much time as I can!\u201d Every second matters, and these are bound to be my last\u2014 our last. In the span of one heartbeat, I look over my shoulder , past Tairn, and see the flaming ruins of the trading post. Townspeople run from the city walls, fleeing the wyvern that circle above. My stomach drops at our failure\u2014we haven\u2019 t managed to evacuate all the civilians. At the second beat, I draw a stuttered breath of smoke-laden air as a lone gryphon flies through the haze, followed by Garrick and Imog en on their dragons, and I can only hope the others are still alive. In the third heartbeat, I turn back toward Liam\u2019 s and Deigh\u2019 s lifeless bodies, and rage floods my veins faster than any lightning strike I\u2019ve ever wielded. The horde of wyvern behind Xaden\u2019 s wall will tear into Tairn andSgaeyl just like Deigh. And Xaden \u2026 No matter how strong he is, Xaden won\u2019 t be able to hold them forever. His arms already shake with the effort of controlli ng so much power . He\u2019ll be the first to die if I\u2019m not exactly what he called me under that tree all those months ago. Violence .

But maybe there is a part of me that\u2019s more like her than I care to admit. Because right now, standing near the dead body of my friend and his dragon\u2014all I want is to show these assholes exactly how violent I can be. I pull my goggl es down as I turn to Tairn\u2019s shoulder , mounting quickly . There\u2019 s no need to ask him to launch, not when our emotions are aligned like this. W e want the same exact thing. Revenge. I buckle the straps across my thighs as Tairn springs upward, taking off with heavy beats of his massive wings. The bloodied wyvern has doubled back, and Tairn flies straight at it. I don\u2019t even care if it\u2019s the same one that just killed our friends. They\u2019re all going to die. As soon as we get close enoug h, I throw my hands out, letting all my power loose with a guttural scream. Lightning hits the wyvern on the first shot, sending the monster plummeting to the ground near the city walls. But I never see the one coming at us from the left.",

It comes so close that I feel the singe of heat along my cheek. Tairn rolls, executing a dizzying climb that throws my weight back into the saddle, and yet the venin holds fast, grabbing on to the embedded sword as her feet fly out from under her. The second Tairn levels off, the venin stares at me like I\u2019m her next meal, striding for me with nothing but resolve in her eyes and fisting serrated green-tipped daggers. \u201cThr ee mor e riderless ones on my tail!\u201d Tairn shouts.

  "By the dying sunlight and the eerie glow of the burning city below us, I dodge the first swipe of her knife, then the second, ducking low and throwing up my forearm to block a downward thrust, halting the plunge of metal jabbing toward my face.

  "\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d Tairn accuses. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lie, staring with wide eyes as dark-black blood sludges through my fingers. Not good. So not good. I won\u2019 t be able to fight another in hand-to-hand, not with the wound in my side, and soon I\u2019ll be too weak to wield. The strength is flowing out of me with my blood. I sheathe the dagger . My best weapon now is my mind. Taking a deep breath, I fight to steady my heartbeat and think . \u201cThey\u2019r e falling,\u201d Tairn says, and I jerk my gaze from my side to see three wyvern tumble from the sky and crash to the earth. Riderless wyvern. Created by venin. And they all died because I killed one venin. That\u2019 s what Liam was trying to tell me. When a dragon dies, so does its rider. But apparently when a venin dies, so do the wyvern they created. All of them. That\u2019 s how we can save everyone on this battlefield.",
  "There are two riders among the horde Xaden is holding back. \u201cWe have to take out the riders,\u201d I whisper . \u201cYes,\u201d Tairn agrees, following my thoughts. \u201cExcellent idea.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re willing to gamble your life on it?\u201d If I\u2019m wrong, we\u2019re both dead, and so are Xaden and Sgaeyl. \u201cI will bet my life on you as I have from the first day,\u201d he says, bankin g to fly back to the valley as the other dragons rush with their riders to follow us, no doubt following Tairn\u2019s command. Only Garrick and his Brown Scorpiontail are ahead of us, flying low and fast toward Xaden. \u201cThr ee ofthe venin ar e dead, but one is\u2014\u201d I watch in horro r as a venin with a staff as tall as he is strides out of the darkness, his menacing gaze locked on Xaden. \u201cTo the left!\u201d I scream at Xaden. Sgaeyl spins and blasts fire at the venin, but he doesn\u2019 t so much as pause. Garrick leans from his seat and flings a dagger , but before it can reach the venin, the robed figure slams his staf f into the ground and disappears like he was never there in the first place. He moved. But to where? \u201cThe hell?\u201d I shout into the wind.",
  "\u201cA general can recognize another general, and that\u2019s their leader ,\u201d Tairn says.",
  "The Sage? \u201cI can\u2019t hold them back much longer!\u201d Xaden yells, his arms shaking so hard, it looks like his body is tearing itself apart at the very seams as we rush toward the mouth of the valley . \u201cNew plan ,\u201d I tell Xaden as Tairn pushes himself to the max. \u201cI need you to let the shadows fall.\u201d \u201cWHA T?\u201d He\u2019s already wavering; I can see it by the straining shapes against his shadows, wyvern desperate to push their way through. \u201cSo much suffering.\u201d The hurt in Andarna\u2019 s voice jars me. I whip my head back toward the trading post and catch the glint of gold. My heart seizes. \u201cNo! It\u2019 s not safe for you her e!\u201d \u201cYou need me!\u201d she yells. \u201cPlease hide. One of us has to survive this,\u201d I tell her as Tairn flies past Xaden and Sgaeyl. \u201cXaden, you have to dr op the shadows. It\u2019 s the only way .\u201d \u201cTairn!\u201d Sgaeyl shouts, fear edging her tone in a way I\u2019ve never heard. \u201cDon\u2019 t ask that of me.\u201d Even Xaden\u2019 s voice shakes. Those shadows are coming down whether or not he wants them to.",
  "He\u2019 s approaching burnout.\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever trusted me, Xaden, I need you to do it now,\u201d I use his earlier words, barely breathing through the searing pain in my side. He\u2019ll lose himself to burnout if he doesn\u2019 t trust me. \u201cFuck!\u201d In a blink, the wall of shadow falls, and the wyvern fly towar d us with terrifying speed. If I can\u2019t do this, no one will survive. There are too many of them. \u201cSpot the mor e powerful rider , Tairn.\u201d It\u2019s the best bet. The only bet.",
  "We\u2019re a minute away from a collision. \u201cOnce I\u2019ve taken the rider out, that only leaves one, Xaden. Just kill that one and the r est of the wyvern will fall.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d But I\u2019ll get there first. Tairn is faster than Sgaeyl. \u201cYou saved us by holding them back this long.\u201d When he starts to respond, I slam my shield down, blocking him out to concentrate. Tairn\u2019s head swivels left and right, searching, and I break apart the last of my Archives walls, keeping one foot firmly on that marble floor . \u201cTher e,\u201d Tairn says, his head turned to the right. \u201cThat one.\u201d At the corner of the flying horde is a seated venin, crims on veins streaking his temples and traveling down his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re sur e?\u201d I ask. \u201cPositive.\u201d Blue fire erupts from the horde, and I barely draw breath before a torrent of shadows rises from the edges of the valley , snuf fing out the flame. Power ripples in my bones, vibrating my very being with the amount of energy I\u2019m forcing my body to contain. \u201cTell me your plan isn\u2019t to try and jump on the wyvern\u2019 s back?\u201d Tairn asks as my breath hitches. Just a few more seconds and we\u2019ll be close enough.",
  "\u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d I tell him. \u201cDidn\u2019 t you hear what the venin said? I cancommand the sky to surrender all its power , but I\u2019m going to need every ounce of yours to do it.\u201d I unleash my signet and strike once, missing the wyvern, then again, missing once more. They\u2019re almost on us as I strike again and again, pushing myself to the limit as Xaden smothers the blue flames before they have a chance to burn me alive. I can\u2019t aim. I\u2019m not ready . Maybe if I had another year or two to practice, but not now . \u201cI need mor e, Tairn!\u201d \u201cYou will burn out, Silver One!\u201d he growls, dodging a flame Xaden misses. \u201cYou alr eady walk the edge.\u201d My arms shake as I lift them again. \u201cThis is the only way I can save them. I can save Sgaeyl. Y ou just have to decide to live, T airn. Even if I don\u2019 t.\u201d \u201cI will not watch another rider die because they do not know their own limitations. One more strike could be your last.",
  "I feel your waning strength.\u201d \u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m capable of,\u201d I promise as energy fills my body once again, and my heart jolts, struggling to find the right rhyth m. Hot. I\u2019m so damned hot, I feel like I could burst into flame myself. I\u2019ve taken too much power . \u201cI\u2019m not Naolin.\u201d Fear threatens to consume me as the venin rides at us, close enough that I can see his snarling mouth, but it\u2019 s not my terror . It\u2019s Tairn\u2019s. \u201cLet me help!\u201d Andarn a shouts, and my heart swells even as it stutters from the energy flowing through my veins.",
  "I don\u2019t have time to look to see where she is\u2014I only hope she\u2019 s still in the outpost. \u201cOnly what I need ,\u201d I say to her . I swallo w hard, my good hand clutching the blood-tipped dagger as we fly toward the wall of wyvern. I reach for her golden power , and it spreads down my spine and explodes through me, time pausing around us. Tairn flares his wing, bringing us to a hover as the wyvern move toward us inch by precious inch, fighting against Andarna\u2019 s magic with their own.I have to want to kill that venin, and gods help me, I do. \u201cNow!\u201d I push my arms toward the venin and command lightning to split the sky, and it does, branching out in every direction, but I only need to control one of its silver -blue veins. I focus on the one closest to the venin, bringing it down in slow bursts that defy time. My arms vibrate, and I feel Tairn\u2019s power push the boundaries of my body as I yank the branch sideways in its descent, inch by inch with the last of my strength, positioning it over the venin. \u201cMor e, Tairn!\u201d He roars and lightning itself rips through me, sizzling my lungs and charring my very breath as Andarna\u2019 s gift ebbs.",
  "I don\u2019t have to be near her to feel her fatigue, her strength ebbing. But I only take what I need. Andarna will live today , even if she is the only one. I have only a few heartbeats or this much power will burn through me and take me under .",
  "Xaden screams through the barrier in my mind, and the sounds of his anguish and fear are nearly more than I can bear. But there\u2019 s no time to focus on him, to wonder what will happen if I don\u2019t succeed. Because right now, I am focused on vengeance with a coldness that would make even my mother proud. Finally dragging the lightning down into place as my skin sizzles and burns, I release time and hold myself upright long enough to see it strike true, killing the venin at the first touch of its energy. As if time were still frozen, his body slowly topples from the top of his wyvern. In the next breath, more than half the monsters fall from the sky, as if they were struck themselves, and, as if it had been waiting for me to accomplish my goal, the wound in my side threatens to burn me alive. \u201cOn the left!\u201d Tairn roars, swinging toward the wyvern and its rider as they barrel toward us with murder in their eyes. A rope of shadow flies up, wrapping around the venin\u2019 s neck as Tairn banks left to avoid the hit, and I barely manage to keep my seat.Xaden pulls the venin from the wyvern\u2019 s back and yanks him downward, right into the dagger he holds in his outstretched hand. Damn, sometimes I for get just how beautifully lethal he is.",
  "Knowing they\u2019l l all live, I let gravity claim my body and slide from Tairn\u2019s back. \u201cVIOLET!\u201d I hear Xaden\u2019 s scream as I fall.In the event that you come acr oss a poison you do not r ecognize, it is best to tr eat with any and every antidote. Either way , the patient will die, but at least this way you would have learned something. \u2014M AJOR FREDERICK \u2019S MODERN GUIDE FOR HEALERS CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT I think I might die today . Air rushes by and my stomach feels like it\u2019 s somewhere above me. Because I\u2019m falling. Endlessly falling. Tairn roars, and it\u2019s the panic, the pitch of that bellow that forces my eyes open just long enough to see him diving for me, but I can\u2019t feel him in my head, can\u2019t feel my feet on the Archives floor , can\u2019t access my power . I\u2019m cut of f, no longer grounded. My back slams into something, knocking the breath from my lungs, slowing my descent but not stopping it, and shimmering gold rises and ebbs around me. Wind stills, the cries of mayhem and destruction pause, but the burn inside rages on, consuming me with fiery teeth.",
  "Time. Andarna has stopped time with what strength she has left. I\u2019m on her back, falling\u2026because she isn\u2019t strong enough to carry me, but she\u2019s brave enough to fly into this battle. Now my eyes are burning, too. She shouldn\u2019 t be here.",
  "She shou ld be tucked away in the outpost, safe from the wyvern three times her size. Are there any wyvern left? Did we get them all? When time starts again, wind whipping at my exposed skin, I slip from her back and am gathered close by strong human arms.\u201cViolet.\u201d I know that deep, panicked voice. Xaden . But I can\u2019t move, can\u2019t even force my lips apart to scream with the pain of it all when he puts pressure on the wound. \u201cFuck, it must be poison. Y ou have to fight it.\u201d Poison. The green-tipped dagger . But what poison could paralyze me not only physically but magically? \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you. Just\u2026just live. Please live.\u201d Of course he wants me to live. I\u2019m integral to his survival. It takes all my strength, but I manage to lift my eyelids for a second, and the blatant fear in his eyes jolts my heart before I lose consciousness. \u2026 \u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t poison,\u201d someone says in a deep voice as I wake but can\u2019t pry my eyes open. Garrick, maybe?",
  "Gods, everything hurts. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s magic.\u201d \u201cDid you see the way she whip ped that lightning straight at that venin\u2019 s head?\u201d someone asks. \u201cNot now,\u201d Bodhi practically growls. \u201cShe saved your fucking life. She saved all our lives.\u201d But I didn\u2019 t. Soleil and\u2026Liam are dead. \u201cHer blood is fucking black ,\u201d Xaden snaps and his arms tighten, holding me to his chest. \u201cIt has to be poison,\u201d Imogen cries\u2014a sound I\u2019ve never heard from her. \u201cLook at it! We have to get her back to Basgiath. Nolon might be able to help.\u201d Yes. Nolon. They need to take me to Nolon.",
  "But I can\u2019t say it, can\u2019t make my lips move, can\u2019t even reach out along the mental pathways that have become as familiar to me as breathing. Being cut off from Tairn, from Andarna\u2026from Xaden is a torture all on its own. \u201cThat\u2019 s a twelve-hour flight.\u201d Xaden\u2019 s voice rises. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure her arm is broken.\u201dI\u2019ll be dead in twelve hours. The promise of sweet oblivion already hovers at the edge of my consciousness, a promise of peace if I agree to just let go. \u201cThere\u2019 s somew here closer ,\u201d Xaden says quietly , and I feel his fingers skim over my cheek. The motion is unnervingly tender . Another wave of fire consumes me, singeing every nerve, but all I can do is lie there and take it.",
  "Make it stop. Gods, make it stop. \u201cYou can\u2019 t be serious.\u201d Someone\u2019 s voice lowers to a hiss. \u201cYou\u2019ll put everything at risk,\u201d Garrick warns as sleep tugs at me, the only escape from the searing pain. Tairn bellows so loudly , my rib cage vibrates. At least he\u2019 s close. \u201cI would n\u2019t say that again,\u201d Imogen mutters, \u201cor he\u2019ll probably eat you. And don\u2019 t forget, if she dies, there\u2019 s a damn good chance Xaden does, too.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying he shouldn\u2019 t, just reminding him what the stakes are,\u201d Garrick replies. Can Tairn feel the disconnect between us? Is he suffering the same way I am? Was the sword poisoned, too? Can Andarna fly? Or does she need to sleep? Sleep. That\u2019 s what I want.",
  "Cool, blissful, empty sleep. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck what happens to me!\u201d Xaden yells at some one. \u201cWe are going and that\u2019 s an order .\u201d \u201cNo need for orders, man. W e\u2019ll save her .\u201d That\u2019 s Bodhi. I think. \u201cLive up to your nickname and fight this, Violence,\u201d Xaden whispers against my ear. Then he says louder, to someone farther away , \u201cWe have to get her to him. We ride.\u201d I feel the shift as he begins to walk, but the agony of movement against the wound is too much, and I fade into blackness. \u2026 Hours pass before I wake again. Maybe seconds. Maybe days. Maybe it\u2019sforever and I\u2019ve been sentenced to an eternity of torture by Malek for my sheer recklessness, but I can\u2019 t bring myself to regret saving them. Maybe it\u2019 s better if I die. But then Xaden might die. Whatever is wedged between us right now, I don\u2019t want him dead. I\u2019ll never want that. A steady rush of wind at my face and the rhythmic beat of wings tells me we\u2019re flying, and it takes all the energy I have to lift a single eyelid as we pass over the Cliffs of Dralor . The thousand-foot drop is unmis takable.",
  "It\u2019s what made the T yrrish rebellion not only possible but nearly successful. The poison scorches every vein, every nerve ending in my body as it runs through me unchecked, slowin g my heartbeat. Even the irony that I\u2019m going to die by poison, somethi ng I have unparalleled knowledge of, can\u2019t make me muster the energy to speak, to offer any thoughts on an antidote. How can I when I don\u2019t even know what\u2019 s been used on me? Until a few hours ago, I didn\u2019 t even know venin existed outside fables, and now there\u2019 s nothing but pain and death. It\u2019s only a matter of time, and mine is short. \u2026 Death would be preferable to existing for another second in this pyre of a body , but it\u2019 s apparently a mercy I\u2019m not allowed as I\u2019m jostled awake. Air. There\u2019 s not enough air . My lungs struggle to inhale.",
  "\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Imogen asks. Each step Xaden takes brings a new wave of agony that starts in my side and ripples through my whole body . \u201cStop fucking asking him that,\u201d Garrick snaps. \u201cHe made his decision. Support him or get the fuck out, Imogen.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019 s a bad one,\u201d another man retorts. \u201cWhen you have a hundred and seven scars on your back, then you get to make the fucking decisions, Ciaran,\u201d Bodhi snarls.Tairn\u2019s roar startles me, and I twitch, which only intensifies the already indescribable torture racking my body now . \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Garrick asks from somewhere to the left. \u201cHe basically said that he\u2019ll cook me alive if I fail,\u201d Xade n replies, holding me closer . I guess that part of the bond is still in place.",
  "My cheek falls against his shoulder , and I swear I feel him brush a kiss over my forehead, but that can\u2019 t be right. You don\u2019t keep secrets from someone you care about, let alone secrets that are going to cost me my life any second if the stuttering beat of my heart is any indication. It\u2019s struggling to pump the liquid fire that\u2019 s cauterizing my veins. Gods, I wish he\u2019d just let me die. I deserve it. I\u2019m the reason Liam is dead. I\u2019m so weak-mind ed that I didn\u2019 t even realize Dain took my memories and used them against me\u2014 against Liam. \u201cYou have to fight, Vi,\u201d Xaden whispers against my forehead as we move. \u201cYou can hate me all you want when you wake up. You can scream, hit, throw your fucking daggers at me for all I care, but you have to live. You can\u2019t make me fall for you and then die. None of this is worth it without you.\u201d He sounds so sincere that I almost believe him. Which is exactly what got me into this situation in the first place. \u201cXaden?\u201d a familiar voice calls out, but I can\u2019t place it. Bodhi, maybe? One of the second years? So many strangers. And no friends. Liam is dead.",

She chose me for the scars on my back and the simple fact that I am the grandson of her second rider\u2014the one who didn\u2019 t make it through the quadrant.",
  "\u201cYou don\u2019t know that she\u2019ll be all right. No one does.\u201d It\u2019s been three fucking days, and Violet hasn\u2019 t woken up. Three never -ending days I\u2019ve spent in this armchair , walking a knife\u2019 s edge between sanity and madness, studying every rise and fall of her chest just to be sure she\u2019 s still breathing. My lungs only fill when hers do, and the time between my heartbeats is filled with sharp, all-consuming fear . She\u2019s never looked fragile to me, but she does now, lying in the middle of my bed, her lips pale and chap ped, the ends of her hair duller than their usual bladelike hue. For three days, everything about her has felt as though the life was leached from her body, only a shadow of her soul left beneath her skin. But today , at least, the morning light shows her cheeks have a little more color along the darker line of her flight goggles than yesterday . I\u2019m a fucking fool. I should have left her at Basgiath. Or sent her with Aetos, even if it strained Sgaeyl and Tairn. She never should have sufferedthe punishment Colonel Aetos delivered. For a crime she didn\u2019 t even know I was committing. Didn\u2019 t even suspect. I run a hand through my hair .",
  "She wasn\u2019 t the only one who suf fered. Liam would be alive. Liam. Guilt pairs with soul-sucking grief, and I can barely inhale around the pain in my chest. I\u2019d ordered my foster brother to keep her safe, and that order got him killed. His death is on me. I should have known what was waiting for us at Athebyne\u2014 \u201cYou should have told her about the venin. I waited for you to impart the information, and now she\u2019s suffering,\u201d Tairn growls. The dragon is the living, fire-breathing embodiment of my shame. But at least the bond that links the four of us is still in place, even if he can\u2019t communicate with her\u2014 which means V iolet\u2019 s alive. He can yell at me all he wants as long as her heart\u2019 s beating. \u201cI should have done a lot of things differ ently .\u201d What I shouldn\u2019 t have done was fough t my feelings for her. I should have grabbed on to her after that first kiss the way I wanted and kept her at my side, should have let her all the way in.",
  "My eyelids scratch like sandpa per each time I blink, but I\u2019m fighting sleep with every bone in my body . Sleep is where I hear her heartbreaking scream, hear her cry that Liam died, hear her call me a fucking traitor over and over . She can\u2019t die, and not just because there\u2019 s a chance I won\u2019 t survive. She can\u2019t die because I know I can\u2019t live without her even if I do.",
  "Somewhere between the shock of our attraction at the top of that turret to realizing she risked her own life by giving up a boot for someone else on the parapet that first day to her throwing those daggers at my head under the oak tree, I wavered. I should have realized the danger of getting too close the first time I put her on her back and showed her how easily she could kill me on the mat\u2014a vulnerab ility I\u2019ve allowed no one else\u2014but I brushed it off as anundeniable attraction to a uniquely beautiful woman. When I watched her conquer the Gauntlet, then defend Andarna at Threshing, I stumbled, stunned by both her cunning and her sense of honor . When I burst into her room and found Oren\u2019 s treacherous hand at her throat, the rage that made it so easy to kill all six of them without batting an eye should have told me I was headed for a cliff. And when she smiled at me after mastering her shield in mere minutes, her face lighting up as the snow fell around us, I fucking fell. We hadn\u2019 t even kissed, and I fell. Or maybe it was when she threw her knives at Barlowe or when jealousy ate me alive seeing Aetos kiss the mouth I\u2019d dreamed about countless times.",
  "Looking back, there were a thousand tiny moments that pulled me over the edge for the woman asleep in the bed I always pictured her in. And I never told her. Not until she was delirious with poiso n. Why? Because I was scared to give her power over me when she already held it all? Because she\u2019s Lilith Sorrengail\u2019 s daughter? Because she kept giving Aetos second and third chances? No. Because I couldn\u2019 t give her those words without being totally , completely honest with her, and after the way she looked at me at the lake, the utter betrayal\u2014 The rustle of sheets makes my gaze whip to her face, and I take my first full breath since she fell from T airn\u2019s back. Her eyes are open. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d My voice sounds like it\u2019s been dragged across gravel when I thought it\u2019d only been my heart. I stagger to my feet and take the two steps that separate me from her bedside. She\u2019s awake. She\u2019s alive. She\u2019s\u2026smiling?",
  "That must be a trick of the light. This woman likely wants to set me on fire. \u201cCan I check your side?\u201d The mattress depresses slightly as I sit near her hip. She nods and stretches her arms up like a cat who\u2019 s been napp ing in thesun before reaching for the blankets. Drawing back the covers, I untie the robe covering the short nightdress I changed her into that first eveni ng and slowly lift the hem above the silken skin of her hip, preparing myself for the black tendrils that discolored her veins during the flight but receded slowly since we arrived. There\u2019 s nothing. Just a thin silver line an inch above her hipbone. Air gushes from my lungs in relief. \u201cMiraculous.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019 s miraculous?\u201d she croaks, looking down at her new scar . Shit.",
  "I would be a horrible healer . \u201cWater.\u201d My hand shakes with exhaustion, or relief, I don\u2019t even care which, as I pour a glass from the pitcher on my bedside table. \u201cY ou must be parched.\u201d She pushes herself to sit, then takes the glass, drinking the entire thing down. \u201cThanks.\u201d \u201cYou are.\u201d I set the empty glass on the nightstand and then turn back to her, gazing into the hazel eyes that have haunted me since Parap et. \u201cYou are miraculous,\u201d I finish in a whis per. \u201cI was fucking terrified, Violet.",
  "There aren\u2019 t adequate words.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, Xaden,\u201d she says softly , her hand rising to rest above my pounding heart. \u201cI thought I was going to lose you.\u201d The confession comes out strangled, and maybe it\u2019s pushing my luck after all I\u2019ve put her through, but I can\u2019t keep from leanin g forward and brushing my lips over her forehe ad, then her temple. Gods, I\u2019d kiss her forever if I thought it would keep the coming argument at bay, keep us in this one pristine moment where I can actually believe that everything might be all right between us, that I haven\u2019 t irrevocably fucked up the best thing that\u2019 s ever happened to me. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to lose me.\u201d She gives me a puzzled look, smiling like I\u2019ve said something peculiar . Then she leans in and kisses me. She still wants me. The revelat ion makes my heart fucking soar. I take the kiss deeper , swiping my tongue over her soft lower lip and gentlysucking on the tender curve.",
  "That\u2019 s all it takes for need to flood my system, hot and demand ing. It\u2019s always like this between us\u2014the slightest spark sets off a wildfire that consumes every thought that isn\u2019t related to how many ways I can make her moan. We\u2019ll have a lifetime of these moments ahead of us, when I can strip her down to her skin and worship every curve and hollow of her body , but this isn\u2019t one of them, not when she\u2019s barely been awake for five minutes. I draw back, slowly releasing her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you,\u201d I promise, holding her delicate hands between my rough ones. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we won\u2019 t fight or you won\u2019 t want to throw those daggers at me when I\u2019m inevitab ly an ass, but I swear I will always strive to do better .\u201d \u201cMake what up to me?\u201d She pulls away with an inquisitive smile. I blink as my brow furrows. Has she lost her memories? \u201cHow much do you remember? By the time we got you here, the poison spread to your brain and\u2014\u201d Her eyes flare, and something shifts, something that sinks my stomach like a rock as she tugs her hands from mine. She glances away , and her eyes glaze in that way that tells me she\u2019s checking in with her dragons. \u201cDon\u2019 t panic. Everything is fine.",
  "Andarna isn\u2019t quite the same, but she\u2019s\u2026her .\u201d She\u2019s fucking huge now, but I\u2019m not about to say that to Violet. Her gift is also gone, according to Tairn, but there\u2019 s plenty of time to share that news.",
  "Instead , I say , \u201c The healer told me he isn \u2019 t sure what lasting effects the poison might have , because it was something he \u2019 s never seen , and no one really knows how long it will take to get your memories back if there \u2019 s any lasting damage , but I \u2019 ll tell you\u2014 \u201d She throws up her hand and looks around the room , as if noticing where we are for the first time , then scrambles backward out of bed , pulling her robe closed . The look in her eyes puts a vise around my chest as she stumbles to the lar ge windows that line my bedchamber",
  ".The windows that look out over the mountain this fortress is built upon down to the valley below and its line of charred trees markin g where the earth was scorched all the way to stone and the quiet town\u2014which used to be a city\u2014of Aretia beneath us . The town we\u2019ve worked our asses off to rebuild from a pile of cinder and ruins.",
  "\u201cViolet?\u201d I keep my shields up, trying to respect her privacy as I walk to her side, but gods, I need to know what she\u2019 s thinking. Her eyes widen as her gaze sweeps over the town, each structure with its identical green roofs, then pauses on the Temple of Amari, which was the most noted landmark besides our library . \u201cWhere are we? And don\u2019 t you dare lie to me,\u201d she says. \u201cNot again.\u201d Not again. \u201cYou remember .\u201d \u201cI remember .\u201d \u201cThank gods,\u201d I murmur , shoving my hand into my hair . It\u2019s a good thing, proving that she\u2019 s truly healed, but\u2026fuck. \u201cWhere. Are. We?\u201d She bites out every word, her eyes narrowing on me. \u201cSay it.\u201d \u201cThe way you\u2019r e looking at me says you already know .\u201d There \u2019s no way this brilliant woman doesn\u2019 t recognize that temple. \u201cThis looks like Aretia.\u201d She gestures to the window . \u201cThere\u2019 s only one temple with those particular columns. I\u2019ve seen the drawings.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Brilliant. Fucking. W oman. \u201cAretia was burned to the ground.",
  "I\u2019ve seen those drawings, too, the ones the scribes brought back for the public notices. My mother told me she saw the embers with her own eyes, so where are we?\u201d Her voice rises. \u201cAretia.\u201d It feels incredibly freeing to tell her the truth. \u201cRebuilt or never burned?\u201d She turns her back on me. \u201cIn the process of rebuilding.\u201d \u201cWhy haven\u2019 t I read about this?\u201dI start to tell her, but she holds up a hand and I wait. It only takes her a minute to work it out, too. She points to my rebellion relic and says, \u201cMelgren can\u2019t see the outcome when more than three of you are together . That\u2019 s why you\u2019re not allowed to assemble.\u201d I can\u2019t help it. I smile. This brilliant fucking woman is mine. Or was mine. Will be mine again if I have anything to say about it. Which I probably don\u2019 t. I sigh, losing the smile immediately . Fuck. No, I\u2019m not giving up until she tells me to. Things might be complicated, but so are both of us. \u201cThat and we\u2019re not big enoug h to warrant the attention of the scribes anymore. We\u2019re not hidden. We\u2019re just not\u2026advertising our existence.\u201d Which is also the reason this place is still technically\u2026mine.",
  "Nobles weren\u2019 t exactly eager to throw their money at a scorched city or be taxed on unusable land.",
  "Eventually they\u2019ll notice. Eventually I\u2019ll lose it. Then I\u2019ll lose my head. \u201cY ou can know whatever you want. Just ask.\u201d She stif fens. \u201cT ell me one thing right now .\u201d \u201cAnything.\u201d \u201cIs\u2026\u201d Her shoulders stutter as she inhales. \u201cIs Liam really dead?\u201d Liam. A fresh stab of sorrow pierces my ribs. Heartbeats pass in silence as I try to find the right words, but there aren\u2019 t any, so I take from my pocket the palm-size, freshly finished carving of Andarna Liam had been working on. She turns in my direction, her gaze immediately locking on the figurine, and her eyes water . \u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s mine. If I had just told you everything sooner , you would have been prepared. You probably would have schooled us all on how to kill them.\u201d My soul breaks all over again when she swipes at twin tears with the backs of her hands. I set the carving in her hand. \u201cI know I should have, but I couldn\u2019 t bear to burn it. We laid him to rest yesterday .",
  "Well, the others did.I haven\u2019 t left this room since we got here.\u201d Our gazes collide, and it\u2019s all I can do not to reach for her, but I know I\u2019m the last place she\u2019ll seek comfort. \u201cI haven\u2019 t left you.\u201d \u201cWell, you do have a vested interest in my survival,\u201d she quips with a watery , sarcastic smile. \u201cGive me a second to get dressed, and then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d \u201cKicking me out of my own room.\u201d I reach for that sarcastic, teasing tone that used to be so easy when it came to her and back away . \u201cNew one.\u201d \u201cNow , Riorson.\u201d I can\u2019t keep from wincing. She never uses my last name. Maybe it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019 t like to remember that I\u2019m Fen Riorson\u2019 s son, and all my father cost her, but I\u2019ve always been Xaden to her.",
  "The loss feels like a bottomless abyss, like a death blow. \u201cBathing chamber is through there.\u201d I point to the far wall and stride for the exit, swinging my sword over my back on the way out. My cousin is leaned up against the wall, talking to Garrick, who\u2019 s boasting a new six-inch scar from temple to jaw, but they both fall silent as I shut my door behind me. They tense and Garrick stands to his full height. \u201cShe\u2019 s awake.\u201d \u201cThank Amari,\u201d Bodhi says, his shoulders sagging.",
  "His arm is still in a sling, recovering from the four places a venin fractured it. \u201cShe\u2019 s going to have to choose.\u201d I look at Garrick, noting the worry in his eyes. He\u2019s already told me he thinks she\u2019ll keep our secret. That worry is for my mental state if she doesn\u2019 t forgive me for not telling her sooner . \u201cShe\u2019ll either keep our secret or she won\u2019 t.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019 s something you\u2019ll have to figure out,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd then teach her how to hide it from Aetos if she chooses.\u201d \u201cAny word from the fliers?\u201d \u201cSyrena is alive, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d Bodhi answers. \u201cSo is her sister . But the rest\u2026\u201d He shakes his head.At least they made it out, and now that Violet is awake, I can finally breathe. \u201cYou figure out what that box was that Chradh was drawn to back at Resso n?\u201d I ask. Garrick\u2019 s dragon is remarkably sensitive to runes, which allowed them to locate and retrie ve the small iron box beneath the rubble of the clock tower . \u201cThey\u2019re workin g on it right now. Hopefully we\u2019ll have an answer in the next couple of hours. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s all right, Xaden.",
  "I\u2019ll tell the others.\u201d He nods once and heads down the hall, almost as familiar with the castle\u2019 s layout as I am, considering he spent every summer here before the apostasy , or secession , as the Navarrians call Dad\u2019 s rebellion. Funny how people rename everything that makes them feel uncomfortable. We lost faith that our king would ever do the right thing. And they call us traitors.",
  "Bodhi wrinkles his nose. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou smell like dragon ass.\u201d \u201cFuck of f.\u201d I chance a whif f and can\u2019 t argue. \u201cI\u2019m using your room.\u201d \u201cI would consider it a personal favor .\u201d I extend my middle finger and head toward his room. \u2026 An hour later , I\u2019m bathed and impatient as I wait outside my room in a fresh set of leathers with Bodhi, who\u2019 s doing his best to lighten my mood just like he always does, when the door opens and V iolet stands there. I nearly swallow my tongue at the sight of her unbound, damp hair curling just under her breasts. I can\u2019t even articulate what it is about the strands that pushes me straight into need-to-fuck-her -now territory , and I\u2019m too busy fighting to keep my hands at my sides to question the why of it. She exists, and I get turned on. I\u2019ve come to accept that particular truth over the last year .Bodhi grins, flashing a smile that looks exactly like my aunt\u2019 s used to. \u201cGood to see you up and about, Sorrengail.\u201d Then he smacks me on the shoulder as he walks off, looking back over his shoulder .",
  "\u201cI\u2019ll fetch the backup plan. Good luck.\u201d Gods, I want to haul her into my arms and love her until she forgets everything except how good we are together , but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the last thing she\u2019ll ever want again. \u201cCome back in,\u201d she says softly , and my heart lurches. \u201cAs long as you\u2019ve invited me.\u201d I walk in, loathing the distrust in her eyes. Whether or not V iolet will believe me, I\u2019ve never lied to her .",
  "Not once. I\u2019ve just never been entirely truthful, either . \u201cIs all this original?\u201d she asks, her gaze sweeping over my bedroom. \u201cThe majority of the fortress is stone,\u201d I say as she studies the detailed arches at the ceiling, the natura l lighting from the windows that consume the western wall. \u201cStone doesn\u2019 t burn.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d I swallo w. Hard . \u201cI think after all you\u2019ve seen, the question I have to ask before I tell you everything is pretty simple. Are you in? Are you willing to fight with us?\u201d She could just as easily decide to turn us all in. She didn\u2019 t know enough to condemn us, but she does now . \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d She nods. Relief surges through me in a rush more powerful than anything I could channel from Sgaeyl, and I reach for her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I had to keep\u2026\u201d My words die on my tongue as she steps back, avoiding me. \u201cNot happening .\u201d A world of hurt flashes in those hazel eyes, and I fucking wither . \u201cJust because I believe you and am willing to fight with you doesn\u2019 t mean I\u2019ll trust you with my heart again. And I can\u2019t be with someone I don\u2019 t trust.\u201d Something in my chest crumples. \u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you, Violet. Notonce.",
  "I never will.\u201d She walks over to the window and looks down, then slowly turns back to me. \u201cIt\u2019s not even that you kept this from me. I get it. It\u2019s the ease with which you did it. The ease with which I let you into my heart and didn\u2019 t get the same in return.\u201d She shakes her head, and I see it there, the love, but it\u2019s masked behind defenses I foolishly forced her to build. I love her. Of course I love her. But if I tell her now, she\u2019ll think I\u2019m saying it for all the wrong reasons, and honestly , she\u2019d be right. I\u2019m not going to lose the only woman I\u2019ve ever fallen for without a fight. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I kept secrets,\u201d I admit, pressing forward again, taking step after step until I\u2019m less than a foot from her. I palm the glass on both sides of her head, loosely caging her in, but we both know she could walk away if she wanted. But she doesn\u2019 t move. \u201cIt took me a long time to trust you, a long time to realize I fell for you.\u201d Someone knocks.",
  "I ignore it. \u201cDon\u2019 t say that.\u201d She lifts her chin, but I don\u2019t miss the way she glances at my mouth. \u201cI fell for you.\u201d I lower my head and look straight into her gorgeous eyes. She might be rightfully pissed, but she sure as Malek isn\u2019t fickle. \u201cAnd you know what? Y ou might not trust me anymore, but you still love me.\u201d Her lips part, but she doesn\u2019 t deny it. \u201cI gave you my trust for free once, and once is all you get.\u201d She masks the hurt with a quick blink. Never again. Those eyes will never reflect hurt I\u2019ve inflicted ever again. \u201cI fucked up by not telling you sooner , and I won\u2019 t even try to justify my reasons. But now I\u2019m trusting you with my life\u2014with everyone\u2019 s lives.\u201d I\u2019ve risked it all by just bringing her here instead of taking her body back to Basgiath. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything you want to know and everything you don\u2019t. I\u2019ll spend every single day of my life earning back your trust.\u201d I\u2019d forgotten what it felt like to be loved, really , truly loved\u2014it\u2019 d been so many years since Dad died.",
  "And Mom\u2026 Not going there. But then Violetgave me those words, gave me her trust, her heart, and I reme mbered. I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019 t fight to keep them. \u201cAnd if it\u2019 s not possible?\u201d \u201cYou still love me. It\u2019s possible .\u201d Gods, do I ache to kiss her, to remind her exactly what we are together , but I won\u2019 t, not until she asks. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of hard work, especially not when I know just how sweet the rewards are. I would rather lose this entire war than live without you, and if that means I have to prove myself over and over, then I\u2019ll do it. You gave me your heart, and I\u2019m keeping it.\u201d She already owns mine, even if she doesn\u2019 t realize it. Her eyes widen, as if she\u2019 s finally seeing the resolve in mine. It\u2019s time she knew everything. Knowing Violet, she won\u2019 t stay tucked away , safe behind Basgiath\u2019 s walls, especially not now that she knows just how corrupt those walls are. She\u2019ll fight this war at my side. There\u2019 s another insistent knock at the door . \u201cFuck is he impa tient,\u201d I mutter . \u201cYou have about twenty second s to ask a question, if I know him.\u201d She blinks.",
  "\u201cI\u2019m still hoping that missive at Athebyne was really about the War Games.
